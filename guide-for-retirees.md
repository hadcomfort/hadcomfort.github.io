# A Guide for Military Retirees

Military retirees face a unique set of rules when it comes to federal employment and veteran's preference. While you have earned benefits through your service, Congress has placed certain limitations on how preference and service credit apply after a full military career. This guide summarizes the key points you need to know.

## Preference in Hiring (Appointment)

The most significant rule for retirees concerns preference in competitive hiring.

*   **Rule for Majors / Lieutenant Commanders and Above:** Military retirees at the rank of Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher are **not eligible for veteran's preference in hiring** unless they are also a disabled veteran.
*   **Rule for Ranks Below Major:** Retirees below these ranks are generally eligible for preference, provided they meet the underlying service requirements.
*   **Reservist Exception:** This restriction does not apply to Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60.

## Preference in Reductions in Force (RIF)

The rules for RIF are different and more complex. Being a preference eligible for RIF gives you higher retention standing over non-preference employees.

*   **Retirees at/above Major:** You are only eligible for RIF preference if you are a disabled veteran.
*   **Retirees below Major:** You are eligible for RIF preference.

## Crediting Military Service for Federal Benefits

How your military service is counted toward federal benefits like leave and retirement is also different for retirees.

### Leave Accrual
As a retiree, you do not automatically get credit for all your years of military service toward your annual leave accrual rate (i.e., earning 4, 6, or 8 hours per pay period). You only receive credit for:
*   Service during a declared war (e.g., World War II).
*   Service in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized.
*   All active duty if your retirement was for a combat-related disability.

### Federal Retirement
To get credit for your military service in your federal civilian retirement calculation (FERS or CSRS), you must:
1.  Make a deposit to the retirement fund for your years of service.
2.  **Waive your military retired pay** at the time you retire from your civilian job.

You cannot receive both military retired pay and a civilian annuity that includes credit for that same period of service, unless your retired pay is for a combat-related disability or under specific Reserve retirement laws.
