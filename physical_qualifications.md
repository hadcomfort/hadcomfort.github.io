# Physical Qualifications and Waivers

This page addresses how physical qualifications are considered for preference eligibles in federal employment, particularly for positions with specific physical requirements. When determining an individual's qualifications for a federal position, specific rules apply regarding physical and medical standards. These rules ensure that applicants are treated fairly, especially those with disabilities.

## Waiver of Standards

Agencies are required to waive a medical standard or physical requirement if there is sufficient evidence that the employee or applicant can perform the essential duties of the position. This waiver applies under the following conditions:

*   The individual can perform the essential job duties **with or without reasonable accommodation**.
*   Performing these duties does **not endanger the health and safety** of the individual or others.

## Special Provisions for Preference Eligibles with 30% or More Compensable Disability

Additional protections are in place for preference eligibles who have a compensable service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more. If an agency intends to disqualify such a veteran based on physical requirements, or pass them over on a certificate to select a non-preference eligible, the following procedures must be followed:

1.  **Notification:** The agency must notify both the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the disabled veteran in writing of the reasons for the proposed disqualification or pass-over.
2.  **Veteran's Response:** The veteran has the right to respond to OPM within 15 days of receiving the notification, providing any additional information.
3.  **Proof of Notification:** The agency must provide evidence to OPM that the notification was sent to the veteran's last known address in a timely manner.
4.  **OPM Determination:** OPM is responsible for making a final determination on the veteran's physical ability to perform the duties of the position. This determination will consider any information provided by the veteran.
5.  **Compliance with OPM Decision:**
    *   If OPM determines that the veteran **cannot** fulfill the physical requirements, the agency may then select another person from the certificate of eligibles.
    *   If OPM determines that the veteran **can** perform the duties, the agency is not permitted to pass over the veteran for physical reasons.
6.  **Non-delegable Function:** OPM is prohibited by law from delegating this determination function to any other agency.

## Relevant Citations

The guidelines concerning physical qualifications, waivers, and special provisions for disabled veterans are primarily found in:

Ultimately, preference eligibles cannot be disqualified based on physical requirements unless those requirements are essential for the job and alternatives (like reasonable accommodation or waiver) are not possible. An "annuitant" generally refers to someone receiving a retirement annuity. A "compensable disability" refers to a service-connected disability for which monetary compensation is paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
