# A Guide for Spouses of Veterans

As the spouse of a veteran, you may be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) in federal hiring under specific circumstances. This preference is "derived" from the veteran's service and is available only when the veteran is unable to use it themselves. This guide provides a summary of the two main pathways.

## Pathway 1: Spouse of a Living, Disabled Veteran

You may be eligible for preference if you are the spouse of a living veteran who is disqualified from federal employment due to a service-connected disability.

**Key Eligibility Requirements:**
*   The veteran must be unable to work in their usual occupation because of a **service-connected disability**.
*   This disqualification is often presumed if the veteran is unemployed AND has a VA rating of 100% disabled/unemployable, OR retired from civil service due to their disability.
*   If the situation is less clear-cut, the hiring agency will conduct a "more careful analysis."

## Pathway 2: Widow or Widower of a Deceased Veteran

You may be eligible for preference if you are the widow or widower of a veteran, provided you have not remarried (or the remarriage was annulled).

**Key Eligibility Requirements:**
*   You must not have been divorced from the veteran at the time of their death.
*   The deceased veteran's service must meet specific criteria, typically involving service during a war or a qualifying campaign. Service after 1955 that was not in a war or campaign generally does not qualify.

## Important Considerations

*   **Documentation is Crucial:** For either pathway, you will need to complete the **[SF-15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference](./advisor/sf15_information.md)** and provide supporting documents, such as your marriage certificate, the veteran's DD Form 214, and official VA disability or death records.
*   **Key Terms:** Understanding terms like **[Derived Preference](./glossary.md#derived-preference-xp---10-point)** and **[Compensable Service-Connected Disability](./glossary.md#compensable-service-connected-disability)** is essential.
