# Crediting Experience of Preference Eligibles

When evaluating the experience of a preference eligible individual, an examining office employs specific methods to ensure fair consideration of their Armed Forces service and other job-related experiences.

## Armed Forces Service Crediting

The service performed in the Armed Forces by a preference eligible is credited in a way that is most advantageous to them. This can be done in one of three ways:

1.  **As an extension of prior work:** The Armed Forces service is considered a continuation of the work the individual was doing immediately before their service.
2.  **Based on actual duties performed:** Credit is given for the actual responsibilities and tasks undertaken during the military service.
3.  **As a combination of both:** A mix of the two above methods can be used.

The examining office will choose the method that provides the maximum benefit to the preference eligible.

## Credit for Job-Related Experience

In addition to Armed Forces service, all applicants, including preference eligibles, receive credit for any job-related experience. This encompasses:

*   **Paid experience:** Work for which the applicant received compensation.
*   **Unpaid experience:** This includes volunteer work and experience gained through participation in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities.
