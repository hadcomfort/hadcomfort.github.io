# Crediting Experience of Preference Eligibles

This page explains how military service and other relevant experience are evaluated for federal job applications by preference eligibles. When evaluating the experience of a preference eligible individual for federal employment, an examining office employs specific methods to ensure fair consideration of their Armed Forces service and other job-related experiences. These guidelines are based on U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations.

## Armed Forces Service Crediting

The service performed in the Armed Forces by a preference eligible is credited in a way that is most advantageous to them. This can be done in one of three ways:

1.  **As an extension of prior work:** The Armed Forces service is considered a continuation of the work the individual was doing immediately before their service. For example, if a person was a civilian mechanic before entering military service, their military experience as a mechanic could be seen as a direct continuation and development of that work.
2.  **Based on actual duties performed:** Credit is given for the actual responsibilities and tasks undertaken during the military service, regardless of pre-service occupation. For instance, if a person performed logistical coordination or communications duties in the military, that specific experience is credited, even if their pre-service job was in an unrelated field like retail.
3.  **As a combination of both:** A mix of the two above methods can be used. For example, some military duties might directly extend prior work (like a civilian IT specialist continuing IT work in the military), while other new duties learned (such as project management or leadership roles) are also credited based on actual performance.

The examining office is required to choose the method that provides the maximum benefit to the preference eligible, ensuring their military service is valued appropriately.

## Credit for Job-Related Experience

In addition to crediting Armed Forces service, examining offices must give all applicants, including preference eligibles, credit for all relevant job-related experience. This is not limited to paid positions and broadly encompasses:

*   **Paid experience:** Any work for which the applicant received compensation, whether full-time, part-time, temporary, or contractual.
*   **Unpaid experience:** This includes a wide range of activities where valuable skills and knowledge are gained. Examples include:
    *   Volunteer work with non-profit organizations.
    *   Leadership roles in community organizations (e.g., managing a local sports league, coordinating a community event).
    *   Project management in volunteer initiatives (e.g., organizing a fundraiser, leading a neighborhood improvement project).
    *   Extensive unpaid work in a family business, contributing to its operations or management.
    *   Experience gained through participation in religious, civic, welfare, service, and other organizational activities that demonstrate relevant skills.

The key is that the experience, whether paid or unpaid, must be *relevant* to the duties of the position being applied for.
