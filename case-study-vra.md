**Veteran:** John, 25 years old.
**Service:** 4 years active duty, Army. Separated 8 months ago with an Honorable discharge.
**Medals:** National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. No service-connected disability.
**Goal:** Find a position as an IT Specialist (GS-7) in the federal government.

### The Challenge
John was highly skilled but found the traditional federal application process competitive. He noticed a GS-7 IT Specialist position on USAJOBS open to the public, but it had hundreds of applicants.

### The Solution: Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA)
While browsing, John saw another IT Specialist (GS-7) job announcement that included the phrase "This position may be filled using special hiring authorities, including Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA)." He remembered that VRA was a way for agencies to hire veterans without competition.

**How John Qualified for VRA:**
John qualified as a **"recently separated veteran"** because he was within three years of his separation date and had an honorable discharge.

**The Process:**
1.  John applied to the VRA announcement, making sure to select "Veterans Recruitment Appointment" in the application questionnaire.
2.  He submitted his DD Form 214 as proof of his service and honorable discharge.
3.  Because the agency was using the VRA authority, they could review and select eligible VRA candidates directly without going through a large competitive list.
4.  The hiring manager reviewed John's resume, saw his relevant IT experience from the Army, and invited him for an interview.
5.  John was offered the position as a VRA appointee.

### The Outcome
John accepted the GS-7 IT Specialist position. His appointment is an "excepted service" appointment. After two years of satisfactory performance, his position **must be converted** to a permanent, career-conditional appointment in the competitive service. The VRA gave him the opportunity to prove his skills on the job and begin his federal career.
