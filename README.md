## üåü About The Project

Navigating the rules and regulations surrounding U.S. Veteran's Preference for federal employment can be a daunting task. The official guidelines are comprehensive but can be dense and difficult to parse for specific situations. This project aims to bridge that gap.

**Our Mission:** To empower U.S. veterans and their advocates with an intuitive tool and clear information, making the complexities of veteran's preference more understandable and accessible.

**What This Project Offers:**

*   **The Veteran's Preference Advisor:** An interactive, step-by-step tool that guides users through a series of questions to help determine potential eligibility for different types of veteran's preference (0-point, 5-point, 10-point, derived, etc.).
*   **A Comprehensive Information Hub:** Detailed explanations of key concepts, specific appointing authorities (like VRA, VEOA), a glossary of terms, FAQs, and more.
*   **Credible Foundation:** All guidance and logic within the Advisor are meticulously based on the official [OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/) (a copy of which is included in this repository as `hrdocs.txt` for reference).

**Who Is This For?**

*   U.S. Veterans seeking federal employment.
*   Family members (spouses, mothers) exploring derived preference.
*   Veteran Service Officers (VSOs) and advocates.
*   HR professionals looking for a supplementary tool to explain preference.
*   Anyone interested in understanding the intricacies of veteran's preference.
