**Demystifying U.S. Federal and State-Level Veteran's Preference, one click at a time.**

This project provides a clear, accessible, and user-friendly resource for U.S. veterans, their families, and advocates to understand eligibility for veteran's preference in public employment. The site features two primary tools: an interactive **Federal Veteran's Preference Advisor** and a new, comprehensive hub for **State-Level Veterans' Preference Rules**. All content is complemented by a wealth of informational guides, FAQs, and a glossary based directly on official U.S. government guidance.

## üåü About The Project

Navigating the rules surrounding U.S. Veteran's Preference for public employment can be a daunting task. The official guidelines are comprehensive but can be dense and difficult to parse for specific situations. This project aims to bridge that gap.

**Our Mission:** To empower U.S. veterans and their advocates with intuitive tools and clear information, making the complexities of both federal and state-level veteran's preference more understandable and accessible.

**What This Project Offers:**

*   **The Federal Veteran's Preference Advisor:** An interactive, step-by-step tool that guides users through a series of questions to help determine potential eligibility for different types of federal veteran's preference (0-point, 5-point, 10-point, derived, etc.).
*   **The State-Level Preference Hub:** A new, central directory with detailed summaries of veteran's preference rules for public employment in all 50 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico.
*   **A Comprehensive Information Hub:** Detailed explanations of key concepts, specific federal appointing authorities (like VRA and VEOA), a glossary of terms, case studies, and more.
*   **Credible Foundation:** All guidance and logic are meticulously based on official sources like the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals and state-level statutes and resources.

**Who Is This For?**

*   U.S. Veterans seeking federal, state, or local government employment.
*   Family members (spouses, mothers) exploring derived preference.
*   Veteran Service Officers (VSOs) and advocates.
*   HR professionals looking for a supplementary tool to explain preference.
*   Anyone interested in understanding the intricacies of veteran's preference.
