title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Widow/Widower
---

[cite_start]Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the widow/widower of a qualifying veteran[cite: 139, 140].

This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference. Remember to:
* Claim preference when applying for Federal jobs.
* Complete the Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
* Be prepared to provide necessary documentation (e.g., marriage certificate, veteran's death certificate, veteran's proof of qualifying service).

* `"Learn more about applying with 10-point preference (SF-15)"` (Link to OPM guidance on SF-15 or a future detailed info page)
* `[Return to Advisor Start]` -> `start.md`
