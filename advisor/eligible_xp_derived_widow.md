# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Widow/Widower

Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the widow/widower of a qualifying veteran (OPM Vet Guide, sections [139, 140]). If approved, this preference means 10 points are added to your passing score on a civil service examination.

This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference. Remember to:
* Claim preference when applying for Federal jobs.
* Complete the Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
* Be prepared to provide necessary documentation (e.g., marriage certificate, veteran's death certificate, veteran's proof of qualifying service).
