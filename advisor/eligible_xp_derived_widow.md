# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Widow/Widower

Based on your responses through this advisor, you appear to meet the conditions for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the widow/widower of a veteran.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals states:
> *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of ... widows, widowers ... of veterans as described below."*

### Summary of Conditions Met
You have indicated that:

*   You were **not divorced** from the veteran at the time of their death.
*   You have **not remarried** since the veteran's death, or if you did remarry, that remarriage was **annulled**.
*   The veteran's service meets one of the following OPM criteria:
    *   The veteran *"served during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized; or"*
    *   The veteran *"died while on active duty that included service described immediately above under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge."*

If these conditions are officially verified, you should be entitled to 10-point derived preference. The OPM Vet Guide clearly outlines these requirements under the "Widow/Widower" section of "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)."

### Next Steps
This is an initial assessment based on your inputs and **not a final determination**. To claim this preference:

*   Claim preference when applying for Federal jobs.
*   You **must** complete the Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
*   Submit the SF-15 and all requested documentation. This will likely include:
    *   Your marriage certificate (to the veteran).
    *   The veteran's death certificate.
    *   The veteran's DD Form 214 or other official proof of service demonstrating qualifying service or death during qualifying active duty.
    *   If applicable, documentation of annulment of any subsequent remarriage.
