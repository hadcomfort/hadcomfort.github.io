# Understanding the SF-15: Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference

The Standard Form 15 (SF-15) is a crucial document for individuals applying for 10-point veteran's preference in federal employment. This preference is granted to veterans with service-connected disabilities, Purple Heart recipients, and in some cases, to spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans (derived preference).

## What is the Purpose of the SF-15?

The SF-15 is used to formally claim 10-point preference. It helps federal agencies verify your eligibility for this significant benefit in the hiring process. Submitting this form, along with required supporting documentation, is essential if you fall into one of the 10-point preference categories.

## Who Needs to Fill Out the SF-15?

You will need to complete and submit an SF-15 if you are claiming:

*   **10-Point Compensable Disability Preference (CP):** For veterans with a VA disability rating of 10% to 20%.
*   **10-Point 30% Compensable Disability Preference (CPS):** For veterans with a VA disability rating of 30% or more.
*   **10-Point Disability Preference (XP):** For veterans who have a present service-connected disability (regardless of percentage) or are receiving disability retirement benefits, or pension from the military or VA, or for veterans who received a Purple Heart. This category also includes derived preference for eligible spouses, widows/widowers, or mothers of veterans.

If you are only eligible for 5-point preference (TP), you generally do not need to fill out the SF-15. Your DD Form 214 is usually sufficient.

## Where to Find the SF-15

The SF-15 can typically be found on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) website or the GSA Forms Library. It's important to use the most current version of the form.

## General Guidance for Completing the SF-15

1.  **Read the Instructions Carefully:** The form itself contains detailed instructions. Review them thoroughly before filling it out.
2.  **Provide Accurate Information:** Ensure all information matches your official records (like your DD Form 214, VA disability rating letters, etc.).
3.  **Gather Supporting Documentation:** The SF-15 will specify the documentation required based on the type of 10-point preference you are claiming. This often includes:
    *   A copy of your DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).
    *   An official statement or letter from the VA or your branch of service certifying a service-connected disability (e.g., VA rating decision letter).
    *   For derived preference, additional documents like marriage certificates, death certificates, or birth certificates may be needed.
4.  **Submit as Instructed:** Follow the instructions in the federal job announcement for submitting your application package, including the SF-15 and supporting documents.

## Key Points to Remember
