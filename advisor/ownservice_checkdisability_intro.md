# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Considering 10-Point Disability Preference

You are now exploring eligibility for 10-point veteran's preference based on your own service, specifically due to a service-connected disability or receipt of a Purple Heart.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals outlines several categories for 10-point preference for veterans:

**10-Point Compensable Disability Preference (CP):**
> "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of: A veteran who served at any time and who has a compensable service-connected disability rating of at least 10 percent but less than 30 percent."

**10-Point 30 Percent Compensable Disability Preference (CPS):**
> "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of a veteran who served at any time and who has a compensable service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more."

**10-Point Disability Preference (XP):**
> "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of: A veteran who served at any time and has a present service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pension from the military or the Department of Veterans Affairs but does not qualify as a CP or CPS; or A veteran who received a Purple Heart."

Do you have a service-connected disability recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or your branch of service, OR have you received a Purple Heart?
