# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower) - Ineligible: Remarried

Based on your response, you have indicated that you have remarried since the veteran's death and that this remarriage was not annulled.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the "Widow/Widower" subsection of "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," states that to be eligible, the widow or widower of a veteran:
*"...has not remarried, or the remarriage was annulled..."*

Since you have remarried and that marriage was not annulled, you do not meet this specific eligibility criterion for 10-point derived preference as a widow or widower.

*   `"[I made a mistake, I want to change my answer regarding remarriage]"` -> `derived_widow_remarried.md`
*   `"[Return to Relationship Choice]"` -> `derived_intro.md`
*   `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `start.md`
