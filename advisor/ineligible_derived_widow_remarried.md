## Derived Preference (Widow/Widower): Potentially Ineligible - Remarried

To be eligible for derived preference as a widow or widower, you must not have remarried since the veteran's death, or if you remarried, that subsequent marriage must have been annulled (OPM Vet Guide, section [139]). Based on your response, you may not be eligible.
