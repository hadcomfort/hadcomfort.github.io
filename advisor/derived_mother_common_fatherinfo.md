# Mother's Preference - Relationship to Veteran's Father

A fundamental requirement for a mother to be eligible for derived preference, whether the veteran is deceased or living and disabled, concerns her relationship with the veteran's father and her own current status.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals specifies the full criteria for a mother to receive 10-point derived preference.

### Mother of a deceased veteran

For the mother of a veteran who died under honorable conditions on active duty during a war or specific, qualifying military campaigns, she must meet the following conditions:
> *   is or was married to the father of the veteran; **and**
> *   she lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage); **or**
> *   she is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried; **or**
> *   she remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when she claims preference.

### Mother of a disabled veteran

For the mother of a living veteran who is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness, she must meet the following conditions:
> *   is or was married to the father of the veteran; **and**
> *   lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage); **or**
> *   is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried; **or**
> *   remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when she claims preference.

The first of these conditions is that you are or were married to the father of the veteran. Is this true in your case?

*   [Yes, I am or was married to the father of the veteran.](./derived_mother_common_currentmarital.md)
*   [No, I am not nor was I ever married to the father of the veteran.](./ineligible_derived_mother_notmarriedtofather.md)
*   [**Go back to the previous question about the veteran's service/status**](./derived_mother_vetstatus.md)
