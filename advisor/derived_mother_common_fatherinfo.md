# Mother's Preference - Relationship to Veteran's Father

A fundamental requirement for a mother to be eligible for derived preference, whether the veteran is deceased or living and disabled, concerns her relationship with the veteran's father.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals specifies for both "Mother of a deceased veteran" (criterion following [141]) and "Mother of a disabled veteran" (criterion following [146]) that the mother:
*"is or was married to the father of the veteran; and"*

Is this condition true in your case?

* `"Yes, I am or was married to the father of the veteran."` -> `advisor/derived_mother_common_currentmarital.md`
* `"No, I am not nor was I ever married to the father of the veteran."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_mother_notmarriedtofather.md`
* `"[Go back to the previous question about the veteran's service/status]"` -> `advisor/derived_mother_vetstatus.md` (This link might need to be dynamic based on user path, but for now, it points to the general start of mother's preference questions)
* `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `advisor/start.md`
