# Mother's Preference - Relationship to Veteran's Father

Are you now, or were you previously, married to the father of the veteran? (OPM Vet Guide, sections [142, 147])

This is a fundamental requirement. The OPM Vet Guide states that for a mother to be eligible for derived preference, a key condition is that 'she is or was married to the father of the veteran'. This must be true before considering other marital status conditions.
