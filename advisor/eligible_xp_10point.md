# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Eligibility (XP)

Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 10-point veteran's preference (XP). The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide specifies that this preference means "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of: A veteran who served at any time and has a present service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pension from the military or the Department of Veterans Affairs but does not qualify as a CP or CPS; or A veteran who received a Purple Heart." This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference. (OPM Vet Guide, '10-Point Disability Preference (XP)')

Key considerations for XP preference:
* This category applies if you received a Purple Heart OR have a service-connected disability (or receive compensation/pension for it) that does not meet the specific percentage thresholds for CP (10% but less than 30%) or CPS (30% or more).
* You must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions (or expect to be if applying under the VOW Act).
* Applicants claiming 10-point preference must typically complete Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, and submit required documentation.
* For disabled veterans, "active duty" includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard.
* The 24-month minimum active duty service requirement that applies to some 5-point preference situations generally does not apply to those eligible for 10-point preference due to a separation for disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.

Remember to claim preference when applying for Federal jobs and be prepared to provide documentation.
