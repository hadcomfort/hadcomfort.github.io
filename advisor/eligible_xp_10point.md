title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Eligibility (XP)
---

[cite_start]Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 10-point veteran's preference (XP). This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference.

Key considerations for XP preference:
* [cite_start]It can be based on receiving a Purple Heart OR having a service-connected disability (or receiving compensation/pension for it) that doesn't fall into the specific CP (10-20%) or CPS (30%+) categories.
* [cite_start]You must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions (or expect to be if applying under the VOW Act).
* [cite_start]Applicants claiming 10-point preference must typically complete Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, and submit required documentation.
* [cite_start]For disabled veterans, "active duty" includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard.
* [cite_start]The 24-month minimum active duty service requirement that applies to some 5-point preference situations generally does not apply to those eligible for 10-point preference due to a separation for disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.

Remember to claim preference when applying for Federal jobs and be prepared to provide documentation.

Choices:
* "Learn more about applying with 10-point preference (SF-15)" (Link to OPM guidance on SF-15 or a future detailed info page)
