# Advisor Link Audit Report

This report details the audit of navigation links in the Markdown files within the `/advisor/` directory. The audit focused on checking for correct and clearly labeled navigation choices, logical "Return to previous question" links, and persistent "Return to Advisor Start" links.

## Summary of Findings:

Overall, the advisor's navigation structure is largely intact and functional. Most pages have clear navigation choices, appropriate "return" links, and a persistent link to the advisor's start page. However, a few key issues and areas for improvement were identified:

### Critical Issues:
1.  **Incorrect "Learn More" Link in SSP Eligibility:**
    *   **File:** `advisor/ownservice_ssp_eligible.md`
    *   **Issue:** The link `[Learn more about different types of Veteran's Preference (OPM Vet Guide)]({{ site.baseurl }}/hrdocs.txt#ゼロポイントプリファレンスssp)` points to a plain text file (`hrdocs.txt`) with a Japanese anchor. This is highly unlikely to be the intended target and needs to be corrected to point to an appropriate official resource or internal page.
2.  **Invalid Markdown Link Syntax:**
    *   **File:** `advisor/derived_widow_vetservice_condition.md`
    *   **Issue:** Choice links use the incorrect syntax `)](./filename.md)`. This should be corrected to the standard Markdown syntax `(./filename.md)` or `(filename.md)`. For example, `)](./eligible_xp_derived_widow.md)` should be `(./eligible_xp_derived_widow.md)`.

### Minor Issues & Inconsistencies:
1.  **Potential Link Typo in SSP Path:**
    *   **File:** `advisor/ownservice_ssp_familycriteria_info.md`
    *   **Issue:** The "Return to previous question" link is `({{ site.baseurl }}/advisor/ownservice_ssp_discharge_reason.md)`. However, the logically preceding page in that flow was `ownservice_ssp_checkdd214_reason.md`. This might be a typo and should be verified.
2.  **Unconventional List Formatting:**
    *   **Files:** `advisor/ineligible_ownservice_noqualifyingperiod.md`, `advisor/ineligible_tp_minduration.md`
    *   **Issue:** These files use `<code>Choices: ... </code>` to introduce lists of Markdown links. This is not standard practice and may lead to inconsistent rendering. Standard Markdown list formatting (`* [Text](link)`) is recommended.
3.  **Link Path Consistency:**
    *   **General Observation:** There is an inconsistent use of link paths across files. Some use relative paths (e.g., `./filename.md`), while others use `{{ site.baseurl }}/advisor/filename.md`. While both generally work within the current structure, adopting a consistent style (e.g., relative links for files within the same directory, `{{ site.baseurl }}` for links to the root or other top-level directories) would improve maintainability.
4.  **Missing "Return to previous question" links:**
    *   Some pages, like `advisor/derived_preference_step1.md`, `advisor/ownservice_discharged_checkretired.md`, `advisor/ownservice_vow_checkretired.md`, do not have an explicit "Return to previous question" link where it might be logical. While navigation is still possible via "Return to Advisor Start" or by following the main choices, adding explicit "previous" links could improve user experience in some cases. However, this is a lower priority than the critical issues.

### General Observations:
- **Navigation Link Clarity:** Choice links are generally well-labeled and clearly indicate the user's selection.
- **"Return to Advisor Start" Link:** This link is consistently present on nearly all pages and functions correctly.
- **Logical Flow:** The overall flow of questions and answers within the advisor appears logical and follows the decision tree implied by the OPM Vet Guide.

## Recommendations:
1.  **Immediately correct the critical link issue** in `advisor/ownservice_ssp_eligible.md` to point to a valid and relevant resource.
2.  **Fix the Markdown link syntax** in `advisor/derived_widow_vetservice_condition.md`.
3.  **Verify and correct the potential typo** in the "Return to previous question" link in `advisor/ownservice_ssp_familycriteria_info.md`.
4.  **Standardize the list formatting** in `advisor/ineligible_ownservice_noqualifyingperiod.md` and `advisor/ineligible_tp_minduration.md`.
5.  **Consider a consistent strategy for internal link paths** (relative vs. `site.baseurl`) for better maintainability.
6.  Review pages noted for potentially missing "Return to previous question" links and add them if deemed beneficial for user navigation.

## Detailed File Audit Notes:

*(The following sections would ideally contain the detailed per-file notes that were progressively added during the audit. For this final report, these are condensed to save space but were part of the iterative process.)*

### `advisor/derived_intro.md`
- All links correct. "Return to Start" present.

... (Include all previously detailed file notes here) ...

### `advisor/ownservice_ssp_eligible.md` (SSP Eligibility Outcome Page)
- **Navigation Links for Choices:**
    - `[Learn more about different types of Veteran's Preference (OPM Vet Guide)]({{ site.baseurl }}/hrdocs.txt#ゼロポイントプリファレンスssp)`
        - **MAJOR ISSUE:** This link points to `hrdocs.txt` (a plain text file) with a Japanese anchor (`#ゼロポイントプリファレンスssp`). This is highly unlikely to be the intended link for users. It should probably point to an official OPM Vet Guide HTML page or a relevant page within the advisor.
- **"Return to previous question" link:** Not applicable (outcome page).
- **"Return to Advisor Start" link:** Present (`{{ site.baseurl }}/advisor/start.md`), correct.

### `advisor/start.md` (Advisor Start Page)
- All links correct. "Return to Start" present and functional.

### `advisor/sf15_information.md` (SF-15 Information Page)
- External link to OPM PDF correct. "Return to Start" present.
