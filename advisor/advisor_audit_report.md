# Advisor Audit Report (Summary)

This page is intended to provide a summary of the guidance you received from the Veteran's Preference Advisor. Currently, this feature is under development.

## Why This Summary Can Be Helpful

Manually noting down your path and the advisor's assessment can be very beneficial. It helps you to:
*   Keep a personal record of the initial assessment provided by this tool.
*   Prepare for discussions with agency Human Resources (HR) personnel or Veteran Service Officers (VSOs) by having a clear summary of your self-assessment.
*   Gather necessary documentation in advance if the advisor suggests you might be eligible for a particular preference (e.g., DD Form 214, VA rating letters, SF-15).

**Please make a note of the final eligibility outcome page you reached and any key criteria mentioned.**

For example, if the advisor indicated you might be eligible for "10-point Compensable Disability Preference (CP)," you would note:
*   **Outcome:** Potential 10-Point CP Eligibility
*   **Reason:** Service-connected disability rated at 10-29%.
*   **Action:** Need to submit SF-15 and supporting VA documentation.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, this page aims to dynamically generate a report based on your selections throughout the advisor.

### What to Note Down Manually

Until then, we recommend you record the following key pieces of information:
*   **The final eligibility outcome suggested by the advisor** (e.g., 5-point TP, 10-point CP, 10-point XP Derived, Ineligible).
*   **The key reasons or criteria mentioned for that outcome** (e.g., specific campaign medal, VA disability rating percentage, character of service, relationship to the veteran for derived preference).
*   **Any specific forms mentioned as being required** (e.g., SF-15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference).
*   **The general path taken or key answers given** that led to the outcome (e.g., 'Own Service' -> 'Served during Gulf War period' -> 'Received campaign medal' -> 'Honorable discharge').

## Commonly Used Forms

When applying for veteran's preference, certain standard forms are often required.
*   **[SF-15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf15.pdf)**: This is the primary form used to apply for any 10-point preference.
*   Other forms, such as those to document your service (DD Form 214 or equivalent) or VA disability rating, will also be necessary. The specific requirements will be detailed in the job announcement or by the hiring agency.

We appreciate your understanding as we work to improve this tool.
