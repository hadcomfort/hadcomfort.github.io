# Mother's Preference - Ineligible - Living Veteran's Separation Conditions

Based on your response, the separation conditions of the living, disabled veteran do not appear to meet the specific criteria required for a mother to claim 10-point derived preference (XP).

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Mother of a disabled veteran," states that for eligibility, the veteran must have:
*"...was separated with an honorable or general discharge from active duty, including training service in the Reserves or National Guard, performed at any time and is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness..."*

If the veteran was not separated from active duty with an **honorable or general discharge**, then derived preference for a mother is not granted, even if the veteran is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness.

If you believe the veteran's separation conditions were misinterpreted:
*   `"[I want to re-evaluate the veteran's separation conditions]"` -> `derived_mother_living_vetseparation.md`
*   `"[Return to Relationship Choice]"` -> `derived_intro.md`
*   `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `start.md`
