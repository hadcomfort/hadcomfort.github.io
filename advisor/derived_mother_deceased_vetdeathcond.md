# Mother of Deceased Veteran - Conditions of Veteran's Death & Service

To be eligible for derived preference as the mother of a deceased veteran, you must meet two sets of conditions: those regarding your deceased child's service and death, and those regarding your own marital and dependency status.

### Conditions of the Veteran's Service and Death

According to the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, the first part of the eligibility criteria for the "Mother of a deceased veteran" is as follows:

> "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of the mother of a veteran who died under honorable conditions while on active duty during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized;"

A **Note** in the Vet Guide further clarifies a significant limitation:

> "Preference is not given to widows or mothers of deceased veterans who qualify for preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108 (1) (B), (C) or (2). Thus, the widow or mother of a deceased disabled veteran who served after 1955, but did not serve in a war, campaign, or expedition, would not be entitled to preference."

### Conditions for the Mother

In addition to the veteran's service conditions, the OPM Vet Guide states the mother must also meet specific criteria related to her marital status. The guide specifies that she:

> "is or was married to the father of the veteran; and
> * she lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage); or
> * she is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried; or
> * she remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when she claims preference."

### Do You Meet These Conditions?

Considering these combined requirements, please answer the following:

First, did your deceased veteran child die **under honorable conditions** while on **active duty**, AND was this active duty performed during one of the following periods/circumstances?

*   A war declared by Congress (e.g., World War II, which OPM defines from December 7, 1941, to April 28, 1952)? OR
*   The specific period of April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955? OR
*   In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized? (Consult the OPM Vet Guide Appendix A for a list of qualifying campaigns and expeditions.)

**AND** do you, the mother, meet one of the marital status conditions listed above?

*   [Yes, all these conditions regarding both the veteran's service and my own status apply.](./derived_mother_common_fatherinfo.md)
*   [No, one or more of these conditions do not apply. (For example, the veteran died on active duty under honorable conditions, but their service after 1955 was not in a war, campaign, or expedition for which a medal was authorized.)](./ineligible_derived_mother_deceased_vetdeathcond.md)
