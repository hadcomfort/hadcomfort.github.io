title: Mother of Deceased Veteran - Conditions of Veteran's Death & Service
---

Regarding your deceased veteran child: Did they die under honorable conditions while on active duty, AND was this active duty performed during:
* a declared war (e.g., World War II), OR
* the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, OR
* [cite_start]in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized? [cite: 141]

* `"Yes, all those conditions apply."` -> `advisor/derived_mother_common_fatherinfo.md`
* [cite_start]`"No, those conditions do not all apply."` (This may include situations where the veteran's service was after 1955 but not in a war/campaign, making the mother ineligible for derived preference [cite: 152]) -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_mother_deceased_vetdeathcond.md`
* `"[Return to previous question]"` -> `advisor/derived_mother_vetstatus.md`
* `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `advisor/start.md`
