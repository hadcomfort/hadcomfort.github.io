# Mother of Deceased Veteran - Conditions of Veteran's Death & Service

To be eligible for derived preference as the mother of a deceased veteran, specific conditions regarding the veteran's death and service must be met.

According to the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Mother of a deceased veteran":
*"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of the mother of a veteran who died under honorable conditions while on active duty during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized;"*

Additionally, a **Note** in the Vet Guide clarifies:
*"Preference is not given to widows or mothers of deceased veterans who qualify for preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108 (1) (B), (C) or (2). Thus, the widow or mother of a deceased disabled veteran who served after 1955, but did not serve in a war, campaign, or expedition, would not be entitled to preference."*

Considering these guidelines, did your deceased veteran child die **under honorable conditions** while on **active duty**, AND was this active duty performed during one of the following periods/circumstances:
* A war declared by Congress (e.g., World War II, which OPM defines from December 7, 1941, to April 28, 1952)? OR
* The specific period of April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955? OR
* In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized? (Consult the OPM Vet Guide Appendix A for a list of qualifying campaigns and expeditions.)

*   [Yes, all these conditions regarding the veteran's death and service apply.](./derived_mother_common_fatherinfo.md)
*   [No, one or more of these conditions do not apply. (For example, the veteran died on active duty under honorable conditions, but their service after 1955 was not in a war, campaign, or expedition for which a medal was authorized.)](./ineligible_derived_mother_deceased_vetdeathcond.md)
