# Derived Preference (Spouse): Veteran's Status

As a spouse of a veteran, you may be eligible for 10-point derived preference. The OPM Vet Guide (section [129]) states that generally, "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below."

Is the veteran on whose service you are basing your claim currently living?

*   `"Yes, the veteran is living."` -> `advisor/derived_spouse_vetqualifiedforemployment.md`
*   `"No, the veteran is deceased."` -> `advisor/derived_switch_todeceasedpath.md`
