# Derived Preference (Spouse): Veteran's Status

As the spouse of a veteran, you may be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP). This benefit is designed to honor the service of veterans who are unable to use their earned preference themselves.

### Understanding Derived Preference

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," states:

> *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."*

The core idea is that if the veteran cannot use their preference, it may pass to a qualified spouse, widow/widower, or mother.

### Veteran's Current Status

**Is the veteran (on whose service you are basing your claim) currently living?**

**Please select the option that best describes the veteran's status:**

*   [**Yes, the veteran is living.**](./derived_spouse_vetqualifiedforemployment.md)
    <br>*(Select this if the veteran is alive. Further questions will determine their ability to use their own preference.)*

*   [**No, the veteran is deceased.**](./derived_switch_todeceasedpath.md)
    <br>*(Select this if the veteran has passed away. This will typically lead to questions for a widow/widower rather than a spouse of a living disabled veteran.)*
