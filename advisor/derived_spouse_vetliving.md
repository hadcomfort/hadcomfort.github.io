# Derived Preference (Spouse): Veteran's Status

As the spouse of a veteran, you may be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," states:
*"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."*

Is the veteran (on whose service you are basing your claim) currently living?

*   `"Yes, the veteran is living."` -> `advisor/derived_spouse_vetqualifiedforemployment.md`
*   `"No, the veteran is deceased."` (This will typically lead to questions for a *widow/widower* rather than a *spouse* of a disabled veteran.) -> `advisor/derived_switch_todeceasedpath.md`
