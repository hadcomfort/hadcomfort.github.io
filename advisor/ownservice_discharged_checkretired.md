## Own Service: Discharged - Check Retiree Status

Are you a military retiree at the rank of Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher? (This generally does not apply to Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60. See OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference' and Appendix C for rank equivalents).

*   [Yes, I am a retiree at Major/Lt. Commander or higher.](./ownservice_discharged_retiredmajor_isdisabled.md)
*   [No, I am not a retiree at that rank, OR I am a Reservist not yet drawing retired pay until age 60.](./ownservice_discharged_honorableconditions.md)
