# Own Service: Discharged - Check Retiree Status

Are you a military retiree at the rank of Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher? (This generally does not apply to Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60. See OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference' and Appendix C for rank equivalents).

<details>
<summary><strong>Why this matters</strong></summary>
<p>The law (5 U.S.C. 2108) places a specific restriction on veteran's preference for military officers who retire at a senior grade. The government's view is that these individuals have completed a full career and generally do not need the economic "leg up" that preference is designed to provide. However, this restriction is waived if the retiree is also a disabled veteran, acknowledging the greater obligation owed to those injured in service. This question helps determine if that specific restriction applies to you.</p>
