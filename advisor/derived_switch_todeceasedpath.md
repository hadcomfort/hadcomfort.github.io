# Derived Preference: Clarification for Spouse of a Deceased Veteran

You are exploring **derived preference**. The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," explains the general concept:
*"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."*

You initially indicated you are the **spouse** of a veteran, but then stated that the veteran is **deceased**.
In the context of veteran's preference:
*   If you were married to the veteran at the time of their death and meet other conditions (like not remarrying), you would typically apply as a **Widow or Widower**.
*   The term "Spouse" in derived preference rules usually refers to the spouse of a *living* veteran who is unable to use their preference.

How would you like to proceed based on this clarification?

*   `"Yes, I was married to the veteran at the time of death. Proceed to questions for a Widow/Widower."` -> `derived_widow_divorced.md`
*   `"I might be eligible as the Mother of the deceased veteran."` -> `derived_mother_vetstatus.md` (You would then select "Deceased" on that page.)
*   `"The veteran is actually living (I made an error in a previous step)."` -> `derived_spouse_vetqualifiedforemployment.md`
*   `"[I want to re-evaluate my relationship to the veteran]"` -> `derived_intro.md`
*   `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `start.md`
