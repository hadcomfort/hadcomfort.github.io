# Derived Preference: Clarification for Spouse of a Deceased Veteran

You are exploring **derived preference**. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," explains the general concept:

> *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."*

### Understanding Your Situation

You initially indicated you are the **spouse** of a veteran, but then stated that the veteran is **deceased**. This requires a clarification of terms for veteran's preference purposes.

### Clarification of Terms

In the context of veteran's preference:

*   If you were married to the veteran at the time of their death and meet other conditions (like not remarrying), you would typically apply as a **Widow or Widower**.
*   The term "**Spouse**" in derived preference rules usually refers to the spouse of a *living* veteran who is unable to use their preference due to a service-connected disability.

### How to Proceed

**How would you like to proceed based on this clarification?**
