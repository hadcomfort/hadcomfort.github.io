title: Derived Preference: Clarification for Spouse of Deceased Veteran
---

You indicated you are the spouse of a veteran, but that the veteran is deceased.
* If you were married to the veteran at the time of their death and have not remarried (or that remarriage was annulled), you may be eligible as a **Widow/Widower**.
* If you are the mother of the deceased veteran's child and meet other criteria, you might explore eligibility as a **Mother**.

How would you like to proceed?

* `"Proceed as a Widow/Widower."` -> `derived_widow_divorced.md`
* `"Explore eligibility as a Mother."` -> `derived_mother_vetstatus.md` (User would then choose "Deceased")
* `"The veteran is actually living (I made a mistake)."` -> `derived_spouse_vetqualifiedforemployment.md`
* `[Return to Relationship Choice]` -> `derived_intro.md`
* `[Return to Advisor Start]` -> `start.md`
