## Own Service (VOW Act): Ineligible - Discharge Not Expected to be Honorable

Veteran's preference requires eventual discharge or release under honorable conditions. If your VOW Act certification does not indicate an expected honorable discharge, you may not proceed with a claim for preference at this time under the VOW Act. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'A word about the VOW Act').
