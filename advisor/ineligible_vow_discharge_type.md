title: "Own Service (VOW Act): Ineligible - Discharge Not Expected to be Honorable"
---

Veteran's preference requires eventual discharge or release under honorable conditions. If your VOW Act certification does not indicate an expected honorable discharge, you may not proceed with a claim for preference at this time under the VOW Act. (See OPM Vet Guide, section ['A word about the VOW Act']).
