# Own Service (VOW Act): Potentially Ineligible - Discharge Not Certified as Honorable

Based on your response, your VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act certification does not indicate that your service member is expected to be discharged or released from active duty service under honorable conditions.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section "A word about the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act," describes the certification requirement:
> "A “certification” is any written document from the armed forces that certifies the service member is expected to be discharged or released from active duty service in the armed forces **under honorable conditions** within 120 days after the certification is submitted by the applicant." (emphasis added)

It also notes a general requirement for preference in the "Types of Preference" section:
> "To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces under honorable conditions (i.e., with an honorable or general discharge)."

If your certification does not affirm an expectation of discharge under honorable conditions, agencies cannot grant tentative preference under the VOW Act. Final preference eligibility also depends on the actual character of service upon discharge.
