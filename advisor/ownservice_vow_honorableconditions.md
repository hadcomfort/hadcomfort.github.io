# VOW Act: Expected Character of Service & Certification Details

Under the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act, active duty service members expected to be discharged or released within 120 days can be treated as preference eligibles if they meet certain criteria.

One key requirement is that your discharge or release is expected to be under **honorable conditions** (typically an Honorable or General discharge).

You will need a **certification document** from the armed forces. According to the OPM Vet Guide ('A word about the VOW Act'), this certification:
*   Must be a written document from the armed forces.
*   Should be on official letterhead of the appropriate military branch.
*   Must certify that you are expected to be discharged/released under honorable conditions.
*   Must state that this discharge/release will be within 120 days of the certification being submitted with your job application.
*   Should include your military service dates, including the expected discharge or release date, and the character of your service.

**Does your VOW Act certification (or a document you can obtain) meet these requirements and state you are expected to be discharged/released under honorable conditions?**

*   [Yes, my certification meets these requirements and indicates an expected Honorable or General discharge.]({{ site.baseurl }}/advisor/ownservice_checkdisability_intro.md)
*   [No, my certification does not meet these requirements, indicates otherwise, or I cannot obtain such certification.]({{ site.baseurl }}/advisor/ineligible_vow_discharge_type.md)
*   [I need to review the previous VOW Act questions.]({{ site.baseurl }}/advisor/ownservice_vow_checkretired.md)
