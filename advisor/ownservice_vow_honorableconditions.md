## Own Service (VOW Act): Expected Character of Service

To receive preference, discharge must be under honorable conditions. Does your VOW Act certification state you are expected to be discharged/released under honorable conditions (i.e., an Honorable or General discharge)? (See OPM Vet Guide, 'A word about the VOW Act' regarding certification requirements).

*   [Yes, my certification indicates an expected Honorable or General discharge.](./ownservice_checkdisability_intro.md)
*   [No, my certification indicates otherwise, or I cannot obtain such certification.](./ineligible_vow_discharge_type.md)
