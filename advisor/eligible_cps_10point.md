# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Eligibility (CPS)

Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 10-point veteran's preference (CPS). The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide states for this category: "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of a veteran who served at any time and who has a compensable service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more." This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference. This preference means that 10 points are added to your passing score on a civil service examination. Importantly, CPS eligibility may also allow you to be considered for certain positions non-competitively. (OPM Vet Guide, '10-Point 30 Percent Compensable Disability Preference (CPS)')

Key considerations for CPS preference:
* You must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions (or expect to be if applying under the VOW Act).
* Applicants claiming 10-point preference must typically complete Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, and submit required documentation (like your VA rating decision).
* For disabled veterans, "active duty" includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard.
* The 24-month minimum active duty service requirement that applies to some 5-point preference situations generally does not apply to those eligible for 10-point preference due to a separation for disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.

Remember to claim preference when applying for Federal jobs and be prepared to provide documentation.
