# Own Service: 10-Point Preference (XP) - Purple Heart

You indicated that you received a Purple Heart. Having been awarded the Purple Heart typically qualifies you for 10-point Veteran's Preference (XP), provided your discharge was (or will be, if the VOW Act applies) under honorable conditions and all other general eligibility requirements are met.

It's important to note that for disabled veterans, active duty includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard.
