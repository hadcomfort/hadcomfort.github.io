title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential Conditional 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Spouse
---

Based on your responses, you *may* meet the criteria for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the spouse of a veteran disqualified for their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability. If your application for preference is approved after this careful analysis, it means 10 points would be added to your passing score on a civil service examination.

However, because your situation does not fall under the standard presumptions for disqualification, your claim will require a more careful analysis by the hiring agency, and possibly OPM (OPM Vet Guide, section [136]).

Key reminders:
*   Complete the SF-15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
*   Be prepared to provide comprehensive documentation supporting the veteran's service-connected disability and their disqualification from employment in their usual occupation.

This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference.
