title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential Conditional 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Spouse
---

Based on your responses, you *may* meet the criteria for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the spouse of a veteran disqualified for their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability.

However, because your situation does not fall under the standard presumptions for disqualification, your claim will require a more careful analysis by the hiring agency, and possibly OPM (OPM Vet Guide, section [136]).

Key reminders:
*   Complete the SF-15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
*   Be prepared to provide comprehensive documentation supporting the veteran's service-connected disability and their disqualification from employment in their usual occupation.

This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference.

*   `"Learn more about applying with 10-point preference (SF-15)"` #(Link to OPM guidance on SF-15 or a future detailed info page)
