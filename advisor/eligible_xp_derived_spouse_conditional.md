# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential Conditional 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Spouse

Based on your responses through this advisor, you *may* be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the spouse of a disabled veteran. The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals states: *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of the spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability."*

**Summary of Your Situation:**
You have indicated that:
1.  The veteran is living.
2.  The veteran is **not** qualified for Federal employment.
3.  The veteran's disqualification for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation is **because of a service-connected disability**.
4.  However, the veteran's situation does **not** precisely match one of the conditions where *"Such a disqualification may be presumed"* (i.e., 100% VA disability/unemployability rating AND unemployed; or retired/resigned from civil service due to service-connected disability AND unemployed; or failed to qualify for usual occupation due to service-connected disability AND unemployed).

**Guidance from OPM:**
For cases like this, the OPM Vet Guide advises: *"Preference may be allowed in other circumstances but anything less than the above warrants a more careful analysis."*

This means your claim for derived preference is not automatically presumed and will require a thorough review by the hiring agency. If your application for preference is approved after this careful analysis, 10 points would be added to your passing score on a civil service examination.

**Next Steps:**
This is an initial assessment based on your inputs and not a final determination. To claim this preference:
* Claim preference when applying for Federal jobs.
* You **must** complete the Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
* **Crucially**, be prepared to provide comprehensive and compelling documentation that clearly demonstrates:
    * The veteran's service-connected disability.
    * How this disability disqualifies the veteran for a Federal position along the general lines of their usual occupation.
    * The veteran's current employment status.
* Submit the SF-15 and all supporting documentation to the agency.

The agency will then conduct the "more careful analysis" mentioned by OPM.
