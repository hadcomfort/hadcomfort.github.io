# Derived Veteran's Preference - Relationship to Veteran

Derived veteran's preference allows certain relatives of veterans to receive preference in hiring. According to the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, derived preference is when "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans... because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference." This type of preference is usually a 10-point preference, and applicants claiming it must typically complete Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, and submit the requested documentation (as detailed in the OPM Vet Guide, section [34]).

You are seeking to determine potential eligibility for veteran's preference based on the service of a qualifying veteran. This is generally a 10-point preference. What is your relationship to this veteran?
