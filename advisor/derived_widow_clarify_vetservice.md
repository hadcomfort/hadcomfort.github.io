title: Derived Preference (Widow/Widower) - Clarification on Veteran's Service
---

To determine eligibility, please review the veteran's service records (such as the DD Form 214). Specifically, check if their service included:
* A declared war (e.g., World War II: December 7, 1941 - April 28, 1952).
* Service during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955.
* Service in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal was authorized (see OPM Vet Guide Appendix A).
* [cite_start]Also, verify if the veteran died while on active duty during such service, under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge[cite: 140].

[cite_start]You can find details in the OPM Vet Guide under "10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Widow/Widower"[cite: 139, 152].
