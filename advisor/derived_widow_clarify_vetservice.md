# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower) - Clarification on Veteran's Service

You've indicated you need to clarify the veteran's service conditions. To be eligible for derived preference as a widow/widower, it's crucial that the deceased veteran's service met specific criteria outlined in the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals.

### OPM Vet Guide Criteria for Veteran's Service

The OPM Vet Guide, under the section for "Widow/Widower," states that for the widow/widower to be eligible, the veteran must have:

> *"served during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized; or"*

And, if the veteran died while on active duty, that service must have been under honorable conditions:

> *"died while on active duty that included service described immediately above under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge."*

**Key points to verify from the veteran's service records (e.g., DD Form 214):**

*   **Service during a war:** "War" generally refers to a war declared by Congress (e.g., World War II, which OPM defines as December 7, 1941, to April 28, 1952).
*   **Service during specific period:** The period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, is a qualifying timeframe.
*   **Service in a campaign/expedition:** For a list of qualifying campaigns and expeditions (and their authorized medals), consult Appendix A of the OPM Vet Guide.
*   **Death during qualifying active duty:** If the veteran died on active duty, that active duty must have been part of service during a war, the specified 1952-1955 period, or a qualifying campaign/expedition, and the circumstances of death must have been honorable.

### Important Note on Post-1955 Service

It's also critical to consider the following **Note** from the OPM Vet Guide:

> *"Preference is not given to widows or mothers of deceased veterans who qualify for preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108 (1) (B), (C) or (2). Thus, the widow or mother of a deceased disabled veteran who served after 1955, but did not serve in a war, campaign, or expedition, would not be entitled to preference."*

This means if the veteran's service was entirely after July 1, 1955, and was not in a declared war or a campaign/expedition for which a medal was authorized, you, as the widow/widower, would likely not be eligible for this preference.
