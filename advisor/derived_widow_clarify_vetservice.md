# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower) - Clarification on Veteran's Service

You've indicated you need to clarify the veteran's service conditions. To be eligible for derived preference as a widow/widower, the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Widow/Widower," requires that the veteran's service met specific criteria.

Please review the veteran's service records (such as the DD Form 214) to determine if the veteran:
1.  *"served during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized; or"*
    *   "War" typically means a war declared by Congress (e.g., World War II, defined by OPM as December 7, 1941, to April 28, 1952).
    *   The period April 28, 1952, to July 1, 1955, is a specific qualifying timeframe.
    *   For campaigns or expeditions, consult Appendix A of the OPM Vet Guide for a list of qualifying medals.
2.  *"died while on active duty that included service described immediately above under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge."*
    *   This means the veteran died *during* active duty, and that active duty itself was part of service during a war, the specified 1952-1955 period, or a qualifying campaign/expedition.
    *   The conditions of death must have been honorable.

It's also important to consider the **Note** from the OPM Vet Guide:
*"Preference is not given to widows or mothers of deceased veterans who qualify for preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108 (1) (B), (C) or (2). Thus, the widow or mother of a deceased disabled veteran who served after 1955, but did not serve in a war, campaign, or expedition, would not be entitled to preference."*
This means if the veteran's service was entirely after July 1, 1955, and was not in a declared war or a campaign/expedition for which a medal was authorized, you would likely not be eligible for this preference as a widow/widower.
