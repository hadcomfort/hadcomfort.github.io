title: "Own Service (VOW Act): Check Retiree Status"
---

Regarding your upcoming discharge/release: Are you a military retiree (or will you be upon discharge/release) at the rank of Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher? (This generally does not apply to Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60. See OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference' and Appendix C for rank equivalents.)

*   [Yes, I expect to be a retiree at Major/Lt. Commander or higher.](./ownservice_vow_retiredmajor_isdisabled.md)
*   [No, I do not expect to be a retiree at that rank, OR I am a Reservist not anticipating drawing retired pay until age 60.](./ownservice_vow_honorableconditions.md)
