# Own Service (VOW Act): Check Retiree Status

Regarding your **upcoming discharge/release**: Are you a **military retiree** (or will you be upon discharge/release) at the rank of **Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher**? (This generally does not apply to **Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60**. See OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference' and Appendix C for rank equivalents.)

*   [Yes, I expect to be a retiree at Major/Lt. Commander or higher.](./ownservice_vow_retiredmajor_isdisabled.md)
    <br>*(Select this if you will be a military retiree at one of these specified ranks or an equivalent rank.)*
*   [No, I do not expect to be a retiree at that rank, OR I am a Reservist not anticipating drawing retired pay until age 60.](./ownservice_vow_honorableconditions.md)
    <br>*(Select this if you will not be a retiree at such a rank, or if your retirement pay as a Reservist will be deferred.)*
