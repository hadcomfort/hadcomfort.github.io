# Own Service: 5-Point Preference - Minimum Service Enlistment Date Check

For some service periods (like **Gulf War, Post-9/11 OIF, or Campaign Medal service**), a **minimum service duration** applies if you originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, OR began active duty on or after October 14, 1982.

According to the OPM Vet Guide, '5-Point Preference (TP)', this rule generally requires:
> ...**24 months of continuous active duty** OR serving the **full period for which you were called/ordered to active duty**, unless certain exceptions apply (e.g., **disability separation** for 10-point preference, **hardship separation**).

**Did you originally enlist after September 7, 1980, OR first begin any period of active duty on or after October 14, 1982?**

**To proceed, please select the option that best describes your enlistment date:**

*   [**Yes, my original enlistment/active duty started on or after those dates.**](./ownservice_tp_24month_duration.md)
    <br>*(This means the 24-month rule may apply to your service.)*

*   [**No, my original enlistment/active duty for the qualifying service period started before those dates.**](./eligible_tp_5point.md)
    <br>*(If your service was before these dates, the 24-month rule generally does not apply.)*

*   [**Return to previous question**](./ownservice_nodisability_nossps_checkserviceperiod.md)
    <br>*(Select this if you made a mistake and need to check other service periods or preference types.)*
