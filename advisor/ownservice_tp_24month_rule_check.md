title: Own Service: 5-Point Preference - Minimum Service Enlistment Date Check
---

> For some service periods (like Gulf War, Post-9/11 OIF, or Campaign Medal service), a minimum service duration applies if you originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, OR began active duty on or after October 14, 1982. This rule generally requires 24 months of continuous active duty OR serving the full period for which you were called/ordered to active duty, unless certain exceptions apply (e.g., disability separation for 10-point preference, hardship separation; see OPM Vet Guide, '5-Point Preference (TP)').
