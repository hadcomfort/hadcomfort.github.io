# Own Service (VOW Act): Ineligible - Expecting Retirement as Officer (Major/Lt. Cmdr or Higher) Not Claiming Disability

Based on your responses as an applicant under the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act, you have indicated an expectation to retire at the rank of Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher, and you are not claiming preference as a disabled veteran.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section "Types of Preference," states a rule that also applies to those anticipating retirement:
*"Military retirees at the rank of major, lieutenant commander, or higher are not eligible for preference in appointment unless they are disabled veterans. (This does not apply to Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60.)"*

If you are discharged/released from active duty and retire at one of these ranks without being eligible for preference as a disabled veteran, you generally cannot claim veterans' preference for appointment purposes. This rule is important to consider when using the VOW Act certification for job applications.
