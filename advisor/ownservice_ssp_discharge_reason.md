title: Sole Survivor Preference: Reason for Discharge
---

You indicated your discharge was after August 29, 2008. Was the specific reason stated for your release or discharge from that period of active duty a 'sole survivorship discharge'? [cite_start]This should be documented on your DD Form 214 or other official separation papers. [cite_end]

* "Yes, the reason documented was a 'sole survivorship discharge'." -> advisor/ownservice_ssp_familycriteria_info.md
* "No, the reason documented was different." -> advisor/ineligible_ssp_reason.md
* "I'm not sure / I need to check my DD Form 214." -> advisor/ownservice_ssp_checkdd214_reason.md
* "[Return to previous question (Date of Discharge)]" -> advisor/ownservice_ssp_dischargedate.md
