title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 0-Point Sole Survivor Preference (SSP)
---

Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 0-point Sole Survivor Preference (SSP). [cite_start]This is because you indicated you received a 'sole survivorship discharge' after August 29, 2008, based on qualifying family member service and loss/disability. [cite_end]

Key aspects of 0-point Sole Survivor Preference (SSP) include:
* [cite_start]You do *not* receive additional points added to your passing score or rating. [cite_end]
* [cite_start]You *are* entitled to be listed ahead of non-preference eligibles who have the same score on an examination, or listed ahead of non-preference eligibles in the same quality category when agencies use category rating. [cite_end]
* [cite_start]You *are* entitled to receive the same pass-over rights as other preference eligibles. [cite_end]
* [cite_start]You *are* entitled to credit experience in the armed forces to meet the qualification requirements for Federal jobs. [cite_end]

This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference. Ensure your DD Form 214 or other official separation documents clearly indicate a 'sole survivorship discharge' and the date of discharge.
