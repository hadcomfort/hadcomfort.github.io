**Please select the option that best describes your service duration:**

*   [**Yes, I served 24 months continuously OR the full period for which I was called/ordered.**](./eligible_tp_5point.md)
    <br>*(This means you meet the minimum service duration for this period.)*

*   [**No, I did not complete 24 months OR the full period.**](./ownservice_tp_24month_exceptions.md)
    <br>*(Select this if you did not meet either of these conditions.)*

*   [**I made a mistake with my enlistment date.**](./ownservice_tp_24month_rule_check.md)
    <br>*(This will take you back to the previous question about your service dates.)*
