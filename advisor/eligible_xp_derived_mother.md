# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Mother

Based on your responses through this advisor, you appear to meet the conditions for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the mother of a veteran. The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals states: *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of ... mothers of veterans as described below."*

**Summary of Conditions Met:**
You have indicated that:
1.  The veteran (your son or daughter) is either:
    *   Deceased, having died under honorable conditions while on active duty during a war, or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal was authorized; OR
    *   Living and permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness, having been separated with an honorable or general discharge from active duty (including qualifying training service).
2.  You are or were married to the father of the veteran.
3.  Your current marital/living status meets one of the OPM criteria (e.g., living with a totally and permanently disabled husband; or widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and not remarried; or remarried but now widowed, divorced, or legally separated from that husband).
4.  The veteran, if living, is not qualified for Federal employment.

If these conditions are officially verified, you should be entitled to 10-point derived preference. The OPM Vet Guide clearly outlines these paths for eligibility under "Mother of a deceased veteran" and "Mother of a disabled veteran."

**Next Steps:**
This is an initial assessment based on your inputs and not a final determination. To claim this preference:
* Claim preference when applying for Federal jobs.
* You **must** complete the Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
* Submit the SF-15 and all requested documentation to the agency you are applying to. Necessary documentation will likely include:
    * Proof of your relationship to the veteran (e.g., veteran's birth certificate).
    * Proof of your marriage to the veteran's father.
    * The veteran's DD Form 214 or other proof of service.
    * If the veteran is deceased, a death certificate and proof of the circumstances of death if applicable.
    * If the veteran is living and disabled, official documentation of the veteran's permanent and total service-connected disability rating.
    * Documentation supporting your current marital and living status as declared.
