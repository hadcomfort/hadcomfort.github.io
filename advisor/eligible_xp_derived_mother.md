title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Mother
---

Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the mother of a qualifying veteran (either deceased under specific conditions or living and permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected cause). This preference means that 10 points are added to your passing score on a civil service examination if you are found eligible. (OPM Vet Guide, 'Mother of a Deceased Veteran or of a Living Disabled Veteran (XP)')

This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference. Remember to:
* Claim preference when applying for Federal jobs.
* Complete the Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
* Be prepared to provide necessary documentation (e.g., veteran's birth certificate listing you as mother, proof of your marriage to veteran's father, veteran's proof of service/disability/death as applicable, documentation for your current marital/living status).
