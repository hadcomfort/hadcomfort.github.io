# Derived Preference (Spouse): Veteran's Employment Qualification

Is the living veteran qualified for Federal employment (i.e., able to work and apply for Federal jobs)?

It's important to understand a key condition from the OPM Vet Guide (section [131]): for derived preference, "neither [mother nor spouse] may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."

*   `"Yes, the veteran is living and qualified for Federal employment."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_spouse_vetqualified.md`
*   `"No, the veteran is living but is NOT qualified for Federal employment."` -> `advisor/derived_spouse_vetdisabilityreason.md`
