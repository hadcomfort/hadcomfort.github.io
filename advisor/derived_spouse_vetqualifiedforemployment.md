# Derived Preference (Spouse): Veteran's Employment Qualification

You've indicated the veteran is currently living. The next crucial factor is whether the veteran is qualified for Federal employment, as this directly impacts potential eligibility for derived preference.

### Core Principle: Veteran's Ability to Use Preference

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," states a general rule regarding a living veteran's ability to use their own preference:

> *"However, neither [a mother nor a spouse (including widow or widower)] may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."*

This means if the veteran is alive and can use their own preference, derived preference is generally not available to a spouse.

### Condition for Spousal Derived Preference

Furthermore, for a spouse to be eligible for derived preference when the veteran is living, the OPM Vet Guide, under "Spouse," specifies that the veteran must be:

> *"disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability."*

This highlights that the *reason* for the veteran not being qualified is key.

### Determining Veteran's Qualification for Employment

**Considering these rules, is the living veteran qualified for Federal employment (i.e., generally able to work and apply for Federal jobs)?**

**Please select the option that best describes the veteran's employment qualification:**

*   [**Yes, the veteran is living and is considered qualified for Federal employment.**](./ineligible_derived_spouse_vetqualified.md)
    <br>*(Select this if the veteran is able to work and could apply for Federal jobs, meaning they can use their own preference.)*

*   [**No, the veteran is living but is NOT qualified for Federal employment.**](./derived_spouse_vetdisabilityreason.md)
    <br>*(Select this if the veteran is unable to work or apply for Federal jobs, potentially due to a service-connected disability that disqualifies them from their usual occupation.)*
