# Derived Preference (Spouse): Veteran's Employment Qualification

You've indicated the veteran is currently living. The next crucial factor is whether the veteran is qualified for Federal employment.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," states a general rule:
*"However, neither [a mother nor a spouse (including widow or widower)] may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."*

Furthermore, for a spouse to be eligible for derived preference, the OPM Vet Guide, under "Spouse," specifies that the veteran must be:
*"disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability."*

Considering these rules, is the living veteran qualified for Federal employment (i.e., generally able to work and apply for Federal jobs)?

*   `"Yes, the veteran is living and is considered qualified for Federal employment."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_spouse_vetqualified.md`
*   `"No, the veteran is living but is NOT qualified for Federal employment (potentially due to a service-connected disability that disqualifies them from their usual occupation)."` -> `advisor/derived_spouse_vetdisabilityreason.md`
