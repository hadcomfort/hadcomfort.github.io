# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower) - Ineligible: Veteran's Service Not Qualifying

Based on your response, the veteran's service does not appear to meet the specific conditions required for you to claim 10-point derived preference (XP) as a widow or widower.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the "Widow/Widower" subsection of "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," states that the veteran must have *either*:
*   *"served during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized; or"*
*   *"died while on active duty that included service described immediately above under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge."*

Furthermore, the **Note** in the Vet Guide clarifies an important restriction:
*"Preference is not given to widows or mothers of deceased veterans who qualify for preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108 (1) (B), (C) or (2). Thus, the widow or mother of a deceased disabled veteran who served after 1955, but did not serve in a war, campaign, or expedition, would not be entitled to preference."*

This means that if the veteran's service was entirely after July 1, 1955, and was **not** in a declared war or a campaign/expedition for which a medal was authorized, AND the veteran did not die on active duty *during such specific qualifying service*, then derived preference for a widow or widower is generally not granted. Your responses suggest this might be the case.
