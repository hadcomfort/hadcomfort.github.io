## Derived Preference (Widow/Widower): Potentially Ineligible - Veteran's Service

For derived preference as a widow/widower, the veteran's service generally must have been during a declared war, specific post-war periods (April 28, 1952 - July 1, 1955), or in a campaign or expedition for which a medal was authorized; [cite_start]OR the veteran must have died on active duty during such qualifying service[cite: 139, 140].

[cite_start]Preference is generally not granted to widows or mothers if the deceased veteran's own preference eligibility was based *only* on other criteria (e.g., service after 1955 that was not in a war or campaign, such as >180 days of active duty or Gulf War service without a specific campaign medal)[cite: 152]. Based on your response, the veteran's service may not qualify for this type of derived preference.
