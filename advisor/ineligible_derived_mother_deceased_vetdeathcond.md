# Mother's Preference - Ineligible - Deceased Veteran's Service/Death Conditions

Based on your responses, the service or death conditions of the deceased veteran do not appear to meet the specific criteria required for a mother to claim 10-point derived preference (XP).

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Mother of a deceased veteran," states that eligibility requires the veteran to have:
*"died under honorable conditions while on active duty during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized;"*

Furthermore, the **Note** in the Vet Guide clarifies an important restriction:
*"Preference is not given to widows or mothers of deceased veterans who qualify for preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108 (1) (B), (C) or (2). Thus, the widow or mother of a deceased disabled veteran who served after 1955, but did not serve in a war, campaign, or expedition, would not be entitled to preference."*

This means if the veteran's service was entirely after July 1, 1955, and was not in a declared war or a campaign/expedition for which a medal was authorized, or if they did not die on active duty *during such specific qualifying service*, then derived preference for a mother is generally not granted.
