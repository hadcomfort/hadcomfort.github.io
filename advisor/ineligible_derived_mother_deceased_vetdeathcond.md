title: Mother's Preference - Potentially Ineligible - Deceased Veteran's Service/Death Conditions
---

[cite_start]For a mother to claim preference for a deceased veteran, the veteran generally must have died under honorable conditions while on active duty during a declared war, specific post-war periods (April 28, 1952 - July 1, 1955), or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal was authorized[cite: 141]. [cite_start]Preference is also generally not granted if the deceased veteran's own preference eligibility was based *only* on other criteria (e.g., service after 1955 not in a war/campaign)[cite: 152]. Based on your responses, these conditions may not be met.
