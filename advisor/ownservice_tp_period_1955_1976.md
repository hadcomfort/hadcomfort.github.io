# Own Service: Service 1955-1976 (>180 days) for 5-Point Preference

You indicated service for more than 180 consecutive days (other than for training), with some part after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976. This service generally qualifies for 5-point preference (TP). The 24-month minimum active duty service requirement typically applies only to veterans who originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, or first began active duty on or after October 14, 1982 (see 38 U.S.C. 5303A(d) and OPM Vet Guide, '5-Point Preference (TP)'). For your service in the 1955-1976 period, did your original enlistment in the Armed Forces occur after September 7, 1980, OR did you first begin any period of active duty on or after October 14, 1982?
