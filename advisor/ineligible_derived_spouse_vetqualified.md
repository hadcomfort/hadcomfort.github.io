# Derived Preference (Spouse) - Ineligible: Veteran is Living and Qualified for Employment

Based on your response, you have indicated that the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," provides a general rule for derived preference:
*"However, neither [a mother nor a spouse (including widow or widower)] may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."*

Since the veteran is living and qualified for Federal employment, you, as the spouse, are not eligible for this 10-point derived preference. For a spouse to be eligible, the veteran must generally be unable to use their own preference due to being disqualified from their usual occupation because of a service-connected disability.
