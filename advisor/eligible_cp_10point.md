title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Eligibility (CP)
---

Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 10-point veteran's preference (CP) due to a service-connected disability rating of at least 10 percent but less than 30 percent. This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference.

Key considerations for CP preference:
* You must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions (or expect to be if applying under the VOW Act).
* Applicants claiming 10-point preference must typically complete Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, and submit required documentation (like your VA rating decision).
* For disabled veterans, "active duty" includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard.
* The 24-month minimum active duty service requirement that applies to some 5-point preference situations generally does not apply to those eligible for 10-point preference due to a separation for disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.

Remember to claim preference when applying for Federal jobs and be prepared to provide documentation.

Choices:
* "Learn more about applying with 10-point preference (SF-15)" (Link to OPM guidance on SF-15 or a future detailed info page)
* "[Return to Advisor Start](./start.md)"
