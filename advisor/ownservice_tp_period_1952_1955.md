You indicated service during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955. This service qualifies for 5-point preference (TP), provided your discharge was honorable and other general conditions are met. The 24-month minimum service rule generally does not apply to this period for establishing preference eligibility (OPM Vet Guide, '5-Point Preference (TP)').
