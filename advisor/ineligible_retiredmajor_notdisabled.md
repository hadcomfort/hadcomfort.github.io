# Own Service: Ineligible - Retired Officer (Major/Lt. Cmdr or Higher) Not Claiming Disability

Based on your responses, you have indicated that you are a military retiree at the rank of Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher, and you are not claiming preference as a disabled veteran.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section "Types of Preference," states:
*"Military retirees at the rank of major, lieutenant commander, or higher are not eligible for preference in appointment unless they are disabled veterans. (This does not apply to Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60.)"*

Under this rule, if you are retired at one of these ranks and are not eligible for preference as a disabled veteran, you generally cannot claim veterans' preference for appointment purposes.
