# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower) - Ineligible: Divorced from Veteran

Based on your response, you have indicated that you were divorced from the veteran at the time of their death.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the "Widow/Widower" subsection of "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," states that to be eligible, the widow or widower of a veteran:
> *"...was not divorced from the veteran..."*

Since you were divorced from the veteran, you do not meet this specific eligibility criterion for 10-point derived preference as a widow or widower.
