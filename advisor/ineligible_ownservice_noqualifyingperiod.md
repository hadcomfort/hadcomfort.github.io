# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potentially Ineligible for 5-Point Preference (No Qualifying Service Period or Medal Indicated)

Based on your responses, your active duty service, as described, does not appear to align with the specific conditions required for 5-point veteran's preference (TP). This path assumes you are not claiming preference based on a service-connected disability (10-point preference) or a sole survivorship discharge (0-point preference).

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "5-Point Preference (TP)," outlines the criteria. Generally, five points are added for a veteran who served:
> "During a war; or"
> "During the period April 28, 1952 through July 1, 1955; or"
> "For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976; or"
> "During the Gulf War from August 2, 1990, through January 2, 1992; or"
> "For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred during the period beginning September 11, 2001, and ending on August 31, 2010, the last day of Operation Iraqi Freedom; or"
> "In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized."

If your service does not fall into one of these categories, and you do not meet the minimum duration requirements where applicable (see `ineligible_tp_minduration.md`), you may not be eligible for 5-point preference.

Consider the following:
*   Did you misinterpret any of the service period options?
*   Are you eligible for a campaign medal you did not initially consider? (See OPM Vet Guide Appendix A for a list).
*   Might you be eligible for 10-point preference based on a service-connected disability, or 0-point preference due to a sole survivorship discharge?
