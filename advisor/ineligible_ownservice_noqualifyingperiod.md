# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potentially Ineligible for 5-Point Preference (No Qualifying Period Indicated)

Based on your responses, it appears your service does not fall into the specified periods or involve a qualifying campaign medal for 5-point preference (TP) as a veteran who, in this path, has not indicated a service-connected disability or sole survivorship discharge. (See OPM Vet Guide, section ['5-Point Preference (TP)']). If you made an error or wish to explore other preference types (like based on disability), please return to the relevant section.
