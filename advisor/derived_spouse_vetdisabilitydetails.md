# Derived Preference (Spouse): Veteran's Disability Details

You've indicated the veteran is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Spouse," states that *"Such a disqualification may be presumed when the veteran is unemployed and"* one of the following conditions is met.

Please select the condition that best describes the veteran's situation (assuming the veteran is currently unemployed):

*   `"The veteran is unemployed AND *'is rated by appropriate military or Department of Veterans Affairs authorities to be 100 percent disabled and/or unemployable'*."` -> `advisor/eligible_xp_derived_spouse.md`
*   `"The veteran is unemployed AND *'has retired, been separated, or resigned from a civil service position on the basis of a disability that is service-connected in origin'*."` -> `advisor/eligible_xp_derived_spouse.md`
*   `"The veteran is unemployed AND *'has attempted to obtain a civil service position or other position along the lines of his or her usual occupation and has failed to qualify because of a service-connected disability'*."` -> `advisor/eligible_xp_derived_spouse.md`
*   `"The veteran is disqualified for their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability, and may or may not be unemployed, but none of the specific presumed disqualification scenarios above fully apply, or I'm unsure."` (This may require further clarification as per OPM guidelines.) -> `advisor/derived_spouse_furtherclarification.md`
