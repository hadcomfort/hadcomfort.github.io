You indicated the veteran is disqualified for their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability. Such disqualification may be presumed if the veteran is unemployed AND one of the following situations applies. Which best describes the veteran's situation?

*   `"The veteran is unemployed AND is rated by appropriate military or Department of Veterans Affairs authorities to be 100 percent disabled and/or unemployable."` (OPM Vet Guide, section [133]) -> `advisor/eligible_xp_derived_spouse.md`
*   `"The veteran is unemployed AND has retired, been separated, or resigned from a civil service position on the basis of a disability that is service-connected in origin."` (OPM Vet Guide, section [134]) -> `advisor/eligible_xp_derived_spouse.md`
*   `"The veteran is unemployed AND has attempted to obtain a civil service position or other position along the lines of his or her usual occupation and has failed to qualify because of a service-connected disability."` (OPM Vet Guide, section [135]) -> `advisor/eligible_xp_derived_spouse.md`
*   `"The veteran is disqualified due to a service-connected disability, but none of the specific situations above fully apply, or I'm unsure."` -> `advisor/derived_spouse_furtherclarification.md`
