# Mother's Preference - Ineligible Due to Marital Connection with Veteran's Father

Based on your response, you have indicated that you are not now, nor were previously, married to the father of the veteran.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals specifies a key condition for a mother to be eligible for 10-point derived preference (XP). For both the "Mother of a deceased veteran" and "Mother of a disabled veteran," the guidelines state the mother:
*"is or was married to the father of the veteran; and"*

This is a fundamental requirement. If this condition is not met, you are unfortunately not eligible for derived preference as a mother under these provisions.

*   `"[I made a mistake, I want to change my answer regarding marriage to the veteran's father]"` -> `derived_mother_common_fatherinfo.md`
*   `"[Return to Relationship Choice (e.g., if you are not applying as a mother)]"` -> `derived_intro.md`
*   `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `start.md`
