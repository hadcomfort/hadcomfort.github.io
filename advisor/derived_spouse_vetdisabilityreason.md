title: Derived Preference (Spouse): Reason for Veteran's Non-Qualification
---

Is the veteran disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation *because of a service-connected disability*? (OPM Vet Guide, section [132])

*   `"Yes, due to a service-connected disability."` -> `advisor/derived_spouse_vetdisabilitydetails.md`
*   `"No, the reason is not a service-connected disability."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_spouse_vetnotdisabled.md`
