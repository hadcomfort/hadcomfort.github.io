# Derived Preference (Spouse): Reason for Veteran's Non-Qualification

You've indicated the veteran is living but is NOT qualified for Federal employment. The reason for this is critical for determining spousal derived preference.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Spouse," specifies the condition for eligibility:
*"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of the spouse of a disabled veteran who is **disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability**."* (emphasis added)

Is the veteran disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation **specifically because of a service-connected disability**?

*   `"Yes, the veteran is disqualified for their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability."` -> `advisor/derived_spouse_vetdisabilitydetails.md`
*   `"No, the veteran is not qualified for Federal employment for reasons other than a service-connected disability that disqualifies them from their usual occupation."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_spouse_vetnotdisabled.md`
