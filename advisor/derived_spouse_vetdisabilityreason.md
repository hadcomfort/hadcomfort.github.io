# Derived Preference (Spouse): Reason for Veteran's Non-Qualification

The OPM Vet Guide (section [132]) states that for spousal derived preference, "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of the spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability."

With this in mind, is the veteran disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation *because of a service-connected disability*?

*   `"Yes, due to a service-connected disability."` -> `advisor/derived_spouse_vetdisabilitydetails.md`
*   `"No, the reason is not a service-connected disability."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_spouse_vetnotdisabled.md`
