# Derived Preference (Spouse): Reason for Veteran's Non-Qualification

You've indicated the veteran is living but is NOT qualified for Federal employment. The reason for this is critical for determining spousal derived preference.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Spouse," specifies the condition for eligibility:

> *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of the spouse of a disabled veteran who is **disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability**."*

### Determining Eligibility Based on Disqualification Reason

Is the veteran disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation **specifically because of a service-connected disability**?

**Please select the option that best describes the reason for the veteran's non-qualification:**

*   [**Yes, the veteran is disqualified for their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability.**](./derived_spouse_vetdisabilitydetails.md)
    <br>*(Select this if the veteran's service-connected disability is the direct reason they cannot perform their usual job.)*

*   [**No, the veteran is not qualified for Federal employment for reasons other than a service-connected disability that disqualifies them from their usual occupation.**](./ineligible_derived_spouse_vetnotdisabled.md)
    <br>*(Select this if the veteran's inability to qualify for Federal employment is due to other reasons, not a service-connected disability preventing them from their usual work.)*
