# Derived Preference (Spouse) - Ineligible: Veteran's Disqualification Not Due to Service-Connected Disability

Based on your response, you have indicated that while the veteran may be disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation, this disqualification is **not** because of a service-connected disability.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under the "Spouse" section of "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)," specifies that eligibility is for:
> *"the spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation **because of a service-connected disability**."* (emphasis added)

If the veteran's disqualification from their usual occupation is not due to a service-connected disability, then you, as the spouse, are not eligible for this 10-point derived preference under this specific provision. The service-connected nature of the disability causing the disqualification is a key requirement.
