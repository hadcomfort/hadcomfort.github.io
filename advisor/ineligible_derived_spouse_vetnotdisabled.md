title: Derived Preference (Spouse): Potentially Ineligible - Disqualification Not Due to Service-Connected Disability
---

For a spouse to claim derived preference for a living veteran, the veteran must be disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation *because of a service-connected disability* (OPM Vet Guide, section [132]). Based on your response that the disqualification is not due to a service-connected disability, you may not be eligible for derived preference.
