# Eligible for Sole Survivor Preference (SSP)

Based on your responses, you **may be eligible** for Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP).

**What is Sole Survivorship Preference?**

Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP) is a 0-point preference. This means that while it does not add points to your score in an examination, it grants preference over non-preference eligibles in hiring decisions for federal positions, provided all other requirements for the position are met.

Specifically, if you are an SSP eligible, an agency may not select a non-preference eligible over you unless the agency files a written objection with OPM and OPM approves the agency's request to pass over you.

**Key Conditions Met:**
*   You were released or discharged from active duty after August 29, 2008.
*   Your discharge was by reason of a "sole survivorship discharge."
*   You meet the family survivorship criteria associated with this type of discharge.

**Next Steps:**
*   Ensure you have documentation of your "sole survivorship discharge" (typically found on your DD Form 214 or other official military documents).
*   When applying for federal positions, be sure to claim this preference as instructed in the job announcement.

While this advisor provides guidance, the hiring agency makes the final determination on veteran's preference.
