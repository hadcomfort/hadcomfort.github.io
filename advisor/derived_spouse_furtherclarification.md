# Derived Preference (Spouse): Further Clarification Recommended

You've indicated the veteran is disqualified for their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability, but you did not select one of the specific conditions where, according to the OPM Vet Guide (sections [132-135]), "Such a disqualification may be presumed when the veteran is unemployed and":
*   "is rated by appropriate military or Department of Veterans Affairs authorities to be 100 percent disabled and/or unemployable; or"
*   "has retired, been separated, or resigned from a civil service position on the basis of a disability that is service-connected in origin; or"
*   "has attempted to obtain a civil service position or other position along the lines of his or her usual occupation and has failed to qualify because of a service-connected disability."

OPM further states that "Preference may be allowed in other circumstances but anything less than the above warrants a more careful analysis" (OPM Vet Guide, section [136]).

You will need to provide detailed documentation with your SF-15. This advisor cannot make a determination in such cases, but you may still be eligible.
