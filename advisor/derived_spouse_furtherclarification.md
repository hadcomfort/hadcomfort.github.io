# Derived Preference (Spouse): Further Clarification Recommended

You've indicated that the veteran is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability, but that the situation does not exactly match one of the scenarios where disqualification is typically *presumed*.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Spouse," lists these presumed scenarios:
*"Such a disqualification may be presumed when the veteran is unemployed and"*
*   *"is rated by appropriate military or Department of Veterans Affairs authorities to be 100 percent disabled and/or unemployable; or"*
*   *"has retired, been separated, or resigned from a civil service position on the basis of a disability that is service-connected in origin; or"*
*   *"has attempted to obtain a civil service position or other position along the lines of his or her usual occupation and has failed to qualify because of a service-connected disability."*

If the veteran's situation does not meet one of these specific conditions (for example, if the veteran is not unemployed, or the circumstances of their inability to find work are different), the OPM Vet Guide advises:
*"Preference may be allowed in other circumstances but anything less than the above warrants a more careful analysis."*

This means that while you may still be eligible for derived preference, your situation requires a more detailed review by the hiring agency. You will likely need to provide comprehensive documentation with your SF-15 (Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference) to support your claim that the veteran is disqualified for their usual occupation due to their service-connected disability.

This advisor cannot make a definitive determination in these more nuanced cases.
