title: Derived Preference (Spouse): Further Clarification Recommended
---

You've indicated the veteran is disqualified for their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability, but the specific conditions for a presumed disqualification were not selected. OPM states that preference *may* be allowed in other circumstances, but this "warrants a more careful analysis" by the hiring agency (OPM Vet Guide, section [136]).

You will need to provide detailed documentation with your SF-15. This advisor cannot make a determination in such cases, but you may still be eligible.
