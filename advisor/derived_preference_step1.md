# Derived Veteran's Preference

You are exploring 'derived preference'. According to the OPM Vet Guide (section [129]), for this type of preference, "Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans... This type of preference is usually referred to as 'derived preference' because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."

The OPM Vet Guide also notes that "Both a mother and a spouse (including widow or widower) may be entitled to preference on the basis of the same veteran's service if they both meet the requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."

To determine potential eligibility, we first need information about the **veteran** on whose service this claim is based.

Is the veteran living?

* **[Yes, the veteran is living.](derived_preference_living_vet_step2.md)**
    * *In cases of derived preference for a spouse or mother of a living veteran, specific conditions apply, such as the veteran being unable to use the preference themselves due to disqualification or disability (OPM Vet Guide, sections [131, 147]).*

* **[No, the veteran is deceased.](derived_preference_deceased_vet_step2.md)**
    * *Derived preference for widows/widowers or mothers of deceased veterans also has specific qualifying conditions related to the veteran's service and the circumstances of their death (OPM Vet Guide, sections [140, 142]).*
