# Derived Veteran's Preference - Veteran's Status

You are exploring **derived preference**. The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals explains this under "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)":
*"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."*

The Vet Guide also provides important context:
*"Both a mother and a spouse (including widow or widower) may be entitled to preference on the basis of the same veteran's service if they both meet the requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."*

To determine your potential eligibility, we first need to know the status of the **veteran** on whose service this claim would be based.

Is the veteran currently living?

*   **`"Yes, the veteran is living."`** -> `derived_spouse_vetliving.md` (if spouse) or `derived_mother_vetstatus.md` (if mother, then select "Living").
    *   *Note: If the veteran is living, derived preference for a spouse or mother typically depends on the veteran being unable to use their own preference due to a service-connected disability that disqualifies them from employment, or other specific conditions.*
*   **`"No, the veteran is deceased."`** -> `derived_widow_divorced.md` (if widow/widower) or `derived_mother_vetstatus.md` (if mother, then select "Deceased").
    *   *Note: Derived preference for a widow/widower or mother of a deceased veteran has specific qualifying conditions related to the veteran's service and, for a mother, the circumstances of the veteran's death.*

If you are unsure which path to take based on your relationship, you can return to the relationship selection:
*   `"[Return to Relationship Choice]"` -> `derived_intro.md`
