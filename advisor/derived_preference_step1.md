# Derived Veteran's Preference

[cite_start]You indicated you are seeking preference based on the service of a qualifying veteran, as a spouse, widow(er), or mother[cite: 129]. [cite_start]This is known as "derived preference" because it is based on the service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference[cite: 129].

To determine potential eligibility, we first need information about the **veteran** on whose service this claim is based.

Is the veteran living?

* **[Yes, the veteran is living.](derived_preference_living_vet_step2.md)**
    * [cite_start]*In cases of derived preference for a spouse or mother of a living veteran, specific conditions apply, such as the veteran being unable to use the preference themselves due to disqualification or disability[cite: 131, 147].*

* **[No, the veteran is deceased.](derived_preference_deceased_vet_step2.md)**
    * [cite_start]*Derived preference for widows/widowers or mothers of deceased veterans also has specific qualifying conditions related to the veteran's service and the circumstances of their death[cite: 140, 142].*
