# Mother's Preference: Clarification on Current Marital/Living Status

You've requested clarification on the marital and living status requirements for a mother's derived preference. These conditions apply whether the veteran is deceased or living and disabled.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals states that, in addition to the primary condition that the mother *"is or was married to the father of the veteran"*, she must also meet **one** of the following conditions at the time she claims preference:

*   *"she lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage); or"*
*   *"she is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried; or"*
*   *"she remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when she claims preference."*

**Explanation of these conditions:**

1.  **Living with a totally and permanently disabled husband:**
    *   This husband can be the veteran's biological father.
    *   This husband can also be a man the mother married *after* her connection to the veteran's father (if that ended).
    *   The key is that this current husband must be "totally and permanently disabled."

2.  **Widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father AND has not remarried:**
    *   This applies if the mother's marriage to the veteran's father ended (due to his death, divorce, or legal separation).
    *   Crucially, she must not have remarried *anyone* since that event.

3.  **Remarried, but that subsequent marriage ended:**
    *   This applies if the mother remarried after her connection to the veteran's father ended.
    *   However, that *subsequent* marriage must also have ended (due to the death of that husband, divorce, or legal separation).
    *   Essentially, she is currently not married or is legally separated from her most recent husband at the time of claiming preference.

If your situation is complex, it is highly recommended to consult the full text in the "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)" section of the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, specifically under "Mother of a deceased veteran" or "Mother of a disabled veteran," and review your SF-15 documentation. This advisor aims to clarify but cannot cover every unique circumstance.
