# Mother's Preference: Clarification on Current Marital/Living Status

The rules for a mother's current marital and living status for derived preference can be specific and cover various situations like living with a totally and permanently disabled husband, or being widowed, divorced, or separated and not remarried.

If your situation is complex, please carefully review the OPM Vet Guide sections for "Mother of a deceased veteran" or "Mother of a disabled veteran" and your SF-15 documentation. This advisor cannot cover all nuances.
