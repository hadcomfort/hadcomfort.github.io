# Mother's Preference: Clarification on Current Marital/Living Status

You've requested clarification on the marital and living status requirements for a mother's derived preference. These conditions are a crucial part of determining eligibility and apply whether the veteran is deceased or living and disabled. Understanding these rules are essential for correctly claiming this benefit.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals states that, in addition to the primary condition that the mother > "is or was married to the father of the veteran", she must also meet **one** of the following conditions at the time she claims preference:

> *   *"she lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage); or"*
> *   *"she is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried; or"*
> *   *"she remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when she claims preference."*

**Explanation of these conditions:**

1.  **Living with a totally and permanently disabled husband:**
    *   This husband can be the veteran's biological father or a man the mother married after her connection to the veteran's father ended.
    *   The key is that her current husband must be "totally and permanently disabled." This disability must be certified by a competent authority, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Social Security Administration (SSA).
    *   **Example:** A mother is living with her husband (the veteran's father), who has been rated as 100% permanently and totally disabled by the VA. She would meet this condition.

2.  **Widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father AND has not remarried:**
    *   This applies if the mother's marriage to the veteran's father ended through his death, a divorce, or a legal separation.
    *   Crucially, she must not have remarried *anyone* since the end of that marriage. Her status at the time of claiming preference must be single.
    *   **Example:** The veteran's parents divorced. The mother has not remarried since the divorce. She would meet this condition.

3.  **Remarried, but that subsequent marriage ended:**
    *   This applies if the mother remarried after her marriage to the veteran's father ended.
    *   However, that *subsequent* marriage must also have ended due to the death of her new husband, a divorce, or a legal separation.
    *   Essentially, she must be unmarried (widowed, divorced, or legally separated) at the time of claiming preference.
    *   **Example:** A veteran's father passed away, and the mother remarried several years later. If her second husband also passes away, leaving her a widow, she would then become eligible for preference, provided she has not remarried again.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Proof of Status:** You will need to provide documentation to support your claim. This may include marriage certificates, divorce decrees, death certificates, and official documentation of a spouse's total and permanent disability.
*   **SF-15 Application:** The "Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference" (SF-15) is the standard form for making this claim. It is essential to fill it out accurately and attach all required supporting documents.

If your situation is complex, it is highly recommended to consult the full text in the "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)" section of the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, specifically under "Mother of a deceased veteran" or "Mother of a disabled veteran," and review your SF-15 documentation. This advisor aims to clarify but cannot cover every unique circumstance.
