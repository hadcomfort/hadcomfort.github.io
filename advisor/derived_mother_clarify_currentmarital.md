# Mother's Preference: Clarification on Current Marital/Living Status

To be eligible for derived preference, a mother (of either a deceased or a disabled veteran) must meet specific conditions regarding her marital status. According to the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, the mother:
*   'is or was married to the father of the veteran; and'
*   Additionally, one of the following must be true:
    *   'she lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage); or'
    *   'she is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried; or'
    *   'she remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when she claims preference.'

If your situation is complex, please carefully review the OPM Vet Guide sections for "Mother of a deceased veteran" or "Mother of a disabled veteran" and your SF-15 documentation. This advisor cannot cover all nuances.
