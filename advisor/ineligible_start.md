# Veteran's Preference Eligibility

Based on your initial selection, it appears you may not be eligible for veteran's preference for U.S. Federal employment under the primary categories (your own service or derived preference as a spouse, widow(er), or mother of a veteran).

Veteran's preference is generally granted to:
1.  [cite_start]Veterans who were discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces under honorable conditions and meet specific service criteria[cite: 27].
2.  [cite_start]Certain active duty service members who are expected to be discharged or released from active duty service in the armed forces under honorable conditions within 120 days after the certification is submitted by the applicant (under the VOW Act)[cite: 155, 160].
3.  [cite_start]Certain spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans (derived preference)[cite: 129]. [cite_start]This preference is based on the service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference[cite: 129].

If you believe your situation might involve other specific circumstances not covered by the initial question, you may wish to review the [OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/) directly or consult with a Human Resources specialist at the agency to which you are applying.
