# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Ineligible for 5-Point Preference (Minimum Service Not Met)

To qualify for 5-point preference based on your service period and original enlistment/active duty start date (after Sep 7, 1980/Oct 14, 1982), you generally must have served continuously for 24 months OR the full period for which you were called or ordered to active duty, unless specific exceptions apply (like a separation for service-connected disability qualifying for 10-point preference, or a hardship separation). (OPM Vet Guide, section ['5-Point Preference (TP)']). Based on your responses, it appears you may not meet this minimum service requirement for 5-point preference under this specific service path.
