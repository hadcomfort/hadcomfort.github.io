# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potentially Ineligible for 5-Point Preference (Minimum Service Duration Not Met)

Based on your responses, you may not meet the minimum active-duty service requirement for 5-point preference (TP), particularly if your service began after September 7, 1980 (or you began active duty on or after October 14, 1982, without previously completing 24 months of continuous active duty).

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the "5-Point Preference (TP)" section, states:
*"A campaign medal holder or Gulf War veteran who originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, (or began active duty on or after October 14, 1982, and has not previously completed 24 months of continuous active duty) must have served continuously for 24 months or the full period called or ordered to active duty."*

It further notes:
*"The 24-month service requirement does not apply to 10-point preference eligibles separated for disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, or to veterans separated for hardship or other reasons under 10 U.S.C. 1171 or 1173."* (This is also referenced in 38 U.S.C. 5303A(d)).

If you do not meet this 24-month continuous service requirement (or did not complete the full period for which you were called/ordered to active duty) and the exceptions for disability or specific hardship separations do not apply to you, you may not be eligible for 5-point preference under this rule.
