# Own Service: Ineligible - Discharge Not Under Honorable Conditions

To be eligible for veteran's preference, the nature of your discharge is critical. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide clearly states: "To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces under honorable conditions (i.e., with an honorable or general discharge)." (OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference').

If your discharge was characterized differently (e.g., Other Than Honorable, Bad Conduct, Dishonorable), you generally do not qualify for veteran's preference.
