# Own Service: Ineligible - Discharge Not Under Honorable Conditions

To be eligible for veteran's preference, the nature of your discharge is critical. Federal regulations require an honorable or general discharge for most veteran preference eligibility. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide clearly states:

> "To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces under honorable conditions (i.e., with an honorable or general discharge)." (OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference' and 'Creditable Service').

Other discharge types (e.g., Other Than Honorable, Bad Conduct, Dishonorable) generally do not qualify you for standard veteran's preference, though some exceptions may exist for programs like the Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA).

If your discharge was characterized differently, you generally do not qualify for veteran's preference through this advisor's primary pathways.

**What Next?**
If you believe your discharge records are incorrect or have questions about their characterization and potential for upgrade, you may wish to contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or a Veteran Service Organization (VSO) for advice on how to apply for a discharge review or correction.
