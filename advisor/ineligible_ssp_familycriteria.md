# Sole Survivor Preference - Ineligible: Family Criteria Not Met

Based on your response, the family circumstances you described do not align with the specific criteria required for Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP).

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section "0-point Preference (SSP)," details these family-related conditions. Eligibility is for a veteran who is the only surviving child in a family where:
> ...the father or mother or one or more siblings:
> * served in the armed forces, and
> * was killed, died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in action status, or is permanently 100 percent disabled or hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not employed gainfully because of the disability or hospitalization), where
> * the death, status, or disability did not result from the intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the parent or sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.

If these specific conditions regarding a parent or sibling are not met, you are not eligible for Sole Survivorship Preference, even if you received a "sole survivorship discharge" for other reasons or meet the discharge date requirement.

You may still be eligible for other types of veteran's preference (e.g., 5-point or 10-point disability preference) based on other aspects of your service.
