# Own Service: 10-Point Preference (CPS) - 30%+ Disability

You indicated a service-connected disability rating of 30% or more. This generally qualifies you for 10-point Veteran's Preference (CPS), provided your discharge was (or will be, if VOW Act applies) under honorable conditions and all other general eligibility requirements are met. For disabled veterans, active duty includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard. Remember to complete the SF-15 form.
