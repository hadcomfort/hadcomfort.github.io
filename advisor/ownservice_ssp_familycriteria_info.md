title: Sole Survivor Preference: Basis for Discharge (Information)
---

You've indicated you received a 'sole survivorship discharge' after August 29, 2008. This type of discharge is typically granted to protect 'the only surviving child in a family' where a parent or one or more siblings served in the U.S. Armed Forces AND:

* Was killed, died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease; OR
* Is in a captured or missing in action status; OR
* [cite_start]Is permanently 100 percent disabled or hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not gainfully employed because of the disability or hospitalization). [cite_end]

[cite_start]And, the death, status, or disability did not result from the intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the parent or sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence. [cite_end]

If your 'sole survivorship discharge' was granted based on these family circumstances, you may be eligible for 0-point Sole Survivor Preference (SSP).

* "Yes, this aligns with the basis for my discharge. Proceed to eligibility summary." -> advisor/eligible_ssp_0point.md
* "No, this does not sound like the basis for my discharge, or my discharge was different." -> advisor/ineligible_ssp_reason.md
* "[I need to re-check the reason for my discharge]" -> advisor/ownservice_ssp_checkdd214_reason.md
* "[Return to previous question (Reason for Discharge)]" -> advisor/ownservice_ssp_discharge_reason.md
* "[Return to Advisor Start]" -> advisor/start.md
