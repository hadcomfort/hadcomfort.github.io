# Sole Survivor Preference - Family Criteria

You've indicated that you were discharged under "sole survivorship" provisions. This preference is based on specific family circumstances.

According to the OPM Vet Guide, a "sole survivor" discharge may be granted to an individual who is the only surviving child in a family where:

*   The father or mother, or one or more siblings, served in the U.S. Armed Forces, AND
*   Was killed, died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease, is in a captured or missing in action status, or is permanently 100 percent disabled or hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not employed gainfully because of the disability or hospitalization) as a result of such service, AND
*   The death, status, or disability did not result from the intentional misconduct or willful neglect of the parent or sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.

**Do these family circumstances apply to your situation?**

*   [No, these circumstances do not apply.]({{ site.baseurl }}/advisor/ineligible_ssp_familycriteria.md) <!-- Placeholder, will create this ineligible page if needed, or route to a general one -->
