# Own Service: 5-Point Preference - Minimum Service Duration Exceptions

The **24-month minimum service rule** (or full period if shorter) generally applies if you originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, or began active duty on or after October 14, 1982.

However, according to the OPM Vet Guide, '5-Point Preference (TP)', this rule does **not** apply if you were separated for:
> *   A **service-connected disability** (which would typically make you eligible for 10-point preference), OR
> *   **Hardship** (under **10 U.S.C. 1171** or **10 U.S.C. 1173**).

Do either of these exceptions apply to your situation for the period of service in question?

**To proceed, please select the option that best describes your situation:**

*   [**Yes, I was separated due to a service-connected disability.**](./ownservice_disability_details.md)
    <br>*(This may make you eligible for 10-point preference instead of 5-point.)*

*   [**Yes, I was separated for hardship under 10 U.S.C. 1171 or 1173.**](./eligible_tp_5point.md)
    <br>*(This is a valid exception to the minimum service rule.)*

*   [**No, neither of these exceptions apply.**](./ineligible_tp_minduration.md)
    <br>*(If these exceptions do not apply, you may not meet the minimum service requirement.)*

*   [**Return to previous question**](./ownservice_tp_24month_duration.md)
    <br>*(Select this if you made a mistake regarding your service duration.)*
