title: Own Service: 5-Point Preference - Minimum Service Duration Exceptions
---

The 24-month minimum service rule (or full period if shorter) generally applies if you originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, or began active duty on or after October 14, 1982. However, this rule does not apply if you were separated for a service-connected disability (which would typically make you eligible for 10-point preference) or for hardship (under 10 U.S.C. 1171 or 1173). (OPM Vet Guide, '5-Point Preference (TP)'). Do either of these exceptions apply to your situation for the period of service in question?
