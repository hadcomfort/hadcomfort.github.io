# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Spouse

Based on your responses through this advisor, you appear to meet the conditions for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the spouse of a disabled veteran.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals states:
> *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of the spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability."*

### Summary of Conditions Met
You have indicated that:

*   The veteran is living.
*   The veteran is **not** qualified for Federal employment.
*   The veteran's disqualification for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation is **because of a service-connected disability**.
*   The veteran is unemployed, AND one of the following "presumed disqualification" conditions applies:
    *   The veteran *"is rated by appropriate military or Department of Veterans Affairs authorities to be 100 percent disabled and/or unemployable; or"*
    *   The veteran *"has retired, been separated, or resigned from a civil service position on the basis of a disability that is service-connected in origin; or"*
    *   The veteran *"has attempted to obtain a civil service position or other position along the lines of his or her usual occupation and has failed to qualify because of a service-connected disability."*

If these conditions are officially verified, you should be entitled to 10-point derived preference. The OPM Vet Guide states that:
> *"Such a disqualification may be presumed"* when these conditions are met.

### Next Steps
This is an initial assessment based on your inputs and **not a final determination**. To claim this preference:

*   Claim preference when applying for Federal jobs.
*   You **must** complete the Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
*   Submit the SF-15 and all requested documentation. This will likely include:
    *   Your marriage certificate.
    *   The veteran's DD Form 214 or other proof of service.
    *   Official documentation of the veteran's service-connected disability.
    *   Evidence of the veteran's unemployability and that it meets one of the conditions listed above (e.g., VA rating of 100% disabled/unemployable, documentation of retirement/separation from civil service due to service-connected disability, or evidence of attempts to find work and failure to qualify due to the disability).
