# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 10-Point Derived Preference (XP) - Spouse

Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP) as the spouse of a veteran who is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability (OPM Vet Guide, sections [132, 133, 134, 135]). If approved, this preference means 10 points are added to your passing score on a civil service examination.

This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference. Remember to:
* Claim preference when applying for Federal jobs.
* Complete the Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.
* Be prepared to provide necessary documentation (e.g., marriage certificate, veteran's proof of service-connected disability and unemployability/disqualification for usual occupation).
