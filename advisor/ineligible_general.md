# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Initial Ineligibility

Based on your initial selection, it appears you may not be directly pursuing veteran's preference based on your own service or as a qualifying relative (spouse, widow(er), mother) of a veteran. This advisor is specifically designed to help individuals explore those pathways.

As the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide explains, "Veterans' preference recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position for Government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans." (OPM Vet Guide, 'Why Preference is Given'). This tool helps determine if your service or a family member's service aligns with these established preference eligibilities.
