# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Initial Ineligibility

Based on your initial selection, it appears you may not be directly pursuing veteran's preference based on your own service or as a qualifying relative (spouse, widow(er), mother) of a veteran. This advisor focuses on those categories. Veteran's preference is a specific entitlement for those who served in the Armed Forces during certain periods or campaigns, or have service-connected disabilities, and for certain family members (see OPM Vet Guide, 'Why Preference is Given').
