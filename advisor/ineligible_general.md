# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Initial Ineligibility

You've indicated that you are not seeking veteran's preference based on your own military service or as a qualifying spouse, widow(er), or mother of a veteran. This advisor is specifically designed to help individuals explore those two primary pathways to preference.

As the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide explains:
> "Veterans' preference recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position for Government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans." (OPM Vet Guide, 'Why Preference is Given').

If your situation has changed or if you believe you might fall into one of these categories (preference based on your own service, or derived preference as a spouse, widow(er), or mother), please use the link below to go through the questions again.
