# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Ineligible Service Status

To claim preference based on your own service, you generally need to have been discharged/released from active duty or be an active duty member covered by the VOW Act (expected discharge within 120 days with certification). [cite_start]*(See OPM Vet Guide, 'A word about the VOW Act')*[cite_end]. If neither of these applies, you may not be eligible for preference at this time through this path.
