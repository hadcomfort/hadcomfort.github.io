# Ineligible Based on Current Service Status

Based on your responses, you do not currently meet the preliminary requirements for veteran's preference based on your own service status.

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide states:
> To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces under honorable conditions...

(OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference').

For those still on active duty, the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) to Hire Heroes Act allows consideration if you are:
> expected to be discharged or released from active duty service in the armed forces under honorable conditions within 120 days after the certification is submitted by the applicant.

(OPM Vet Guide, 'A word about the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act').

If neither of these situations applies to you (e.g., you are not yet within 120 days of an expected honorable discharge, or your service has not yet concluded under honorable conditions), you typically would not yet be eligible for preference.
