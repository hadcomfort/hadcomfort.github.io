title: Ineligible Based on Current Service Status
---

Based on your responses, you do not currently meet the preliminary requirements for veteran's preference. Generally, you must be discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions to be eligible. If you are still on active duty, you may be eligible under the VOW Act if you are within 120 days of discharge and can provide a certification. <!-- TODO: Add link to VOW Act info or back to VOW questions if applicable --> For more information, please review the OPM Vet Guide (OPM Vet Guide, section [Appendix A - Definitions of Terms and Categories, Page 31]).
