title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Ineligible Service Status
---

To claim preference based on your own service, you generally need to have been discharged/released from active duty or be an active duty member covered by the VOW Act (expected discharge within 120 days with certification). (See OPM Vet Guide, 'A word about the VOW Act'). If neither of these applies, you may not be eligible for preference at this time through this path.
