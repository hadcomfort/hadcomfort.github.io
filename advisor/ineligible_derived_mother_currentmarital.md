title: Mother's Preference: Potentially Ineligible - Current Marital/Living Status
---

To be eligible for derived preference as a mother, your current marital and living situation must meet specific criteria. These include:
* [cite_start]Living with your husband (veteran's father or remarried husband) who is totally and permanently disabled[cite: 143, 148], OR
* [cite_start]Being widowed, divorced, or legally separated (from veteran's father or subsequent husband) and not having remarried since that event[cite: 144, 145, 149, 150].

Based on your response (currently married and husband is not P&T disabled), you may not meet these conditions.
