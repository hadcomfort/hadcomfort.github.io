# Mother's Preference - Ineligible Due to Current Marital/Living Status

Based on your response regarding your current marital and living situation (e.g., you are currently married and your husband is not totally and permanently disabled), you do not appear to meet the specific conditions required for a mother's 10-point derived preference (XP).

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, for both "Mother of a deceased veteran" and "Mother of a disabled veteran," requires that after meeting the condition of being married to the veteran's father, the mother also meets **one** of the following criteria regarding her current status:

> *"she lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage); or"*

> *"she is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried; or"*

> *"she remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when she claims preference."*

If you are currently married and your husband is not totally and permanently disabled, you do not meet the first condition. Being currently married also means you do not meet the latter two conditions, which require you to be widowed, divorced, or separated and not remarried, or to have a subsequent remarriage that has ended.

Therefore, under these OPM guidelines, you would not be eligible for derived preference as a mother.
