title: Mother's Preference: Potentially Ineligible - Current Marital/Living Status
---

To be eligible for derived preference as a mother, your current marital and living situation must meet specific criteria. These include:
* Living with your husband (veteran's father or remarried husband) who is totally and permanently disabled (OPM Vet Guide, sections [143, 148]), OR
* Being widowed, divorced, or legally separated (from veteran's father or subsequent husband) and not having remarried since that event (OPM Vet Guide, sections [144, 145, 149, 150]).

Based on your response (currently married and husband is not P&T disabled), you may not meet these conditions.

If your situation is complex or not clearly covered by these options, you may want to consult the OPM Vet Guide directly or seek assistance from a Veterans Service Organization.
