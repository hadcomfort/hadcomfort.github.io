# Own Service: Discharged - Character of Service

To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces under honorable conditions. This typically means an Honorable or General discharge. (OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference'). What was the character of your discharge?

*   [**Honorable or General Discharge.**](./ownservice_checkdisability_intro.md)
    <br>*(This is the most common type of discharge for preference eligibility.)*
*   [**Other than Honorable/General (e.g., Undesirable, Bad Conduct, Dishonorable).**](./ineligible_discharge_type.md)
    <br>*(These types of discharges typically do not qualify for veteran's preference.)*
*   [**I'm not sure / Need to check my DD Form 214.**](./ownservice_discharged_checkdd214_discharge.md)
    <br>*(Your DD Form 214 will list the character of your discharge.)*
