# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower): Veteran's Service or Death Conditions

You've indicated you meet the marital status requirements (not divorced at time of veteran's death and not remarried, or remarriage was annulled). The next crucial set of conditions for derived preference as a widow/widower pertains to the veteran's service history, as outlined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

### OPM Criteria for Veteran's Service/Death in Service

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under the "Widow/Widower" section, states that for eligibility, the veteran must meet one of the following conditions:

> *"...served during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized; or"*
>
> *"...died while on active duty that included service described immediately above under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge."*

### Important Clarification (OPM Note)

The Vet Guide includes an important **Note** that further clarifies eligibility:

> *"Preference is not given to widows or mothers of deceased veterans who qualify for preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108 (1) (B), (C) or (2). Thus, the widow or mother of a deceased disabled veteran who served after 1955, but did not serve in a war, campaign, or expedition, would not be entitled to preference."*

This means if the veteran's service was entirely after July 1, 1955, and was not in a declared war or a qualifying campaign/expedition, derived preference is generally not granted based on that service alone.

**Which of these conditions best describes the veteran's service?**
<br>*(Please review the veteran's DD Form 214 or other official service records carefully.)*

*   [The veteran's service met one of these criteria: served during a war (e.g., World War II: Dec 7, 1941 - Apr 28, 1952); OR served during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955; OR served in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized.](./eligible_xp_derived_widow.md)
    <br>*(This option refers to the first OPM criterion listed above.)*

*   [The veteran died while on active duty, AND that active duty included service during a war, or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized, AND the death was under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge.](./eligible_xp_derived_widow.md)
    <br>*(This option refers to the second OPM criterion listed above.)*

*   [The veteran's service was entirely after July 1, 1955, AND was NOT in a war, campaign, or expedition for which a campaign medal was authorized (and the veteran did not die on active duty during such specific qualifying service as described above).](./ineligible_derived_widow_vetservicenotqualifying.md)
    <br>*(This option likely makes you ineligible based on the OPM Note.)*

*   [None of these conditions seem to apply, or I'm unsure and need to check the veteran's records.](./derived_widow_clarify_vetservice.md)
