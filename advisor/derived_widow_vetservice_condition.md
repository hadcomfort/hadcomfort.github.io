# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower): Veteran's Service or Death Conditions

You've indicated you meet the marital status requirements for a widow/widower. The next set of conditions concerns the veteran's service.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Widow/Widower," specifies that for eligibility, "...the veteran either:
*   *'served during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized; or'*
*   *'died while on active duty that included service described immediately above under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge.'*"

A **Note** in the Vet Guide further clarifies:
*"Preference is not given to widows or mothers of deceased veterans who qualify for preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108 (1) (B), (C) or (2). Thus, the widow or mother of a deceased disabled veteran who served after 1955, but did not serve in a war, campaign, or expedition, would not be entitled to preference."*

Which of these conditions best describes the veteran's service?

*   `"The veteran's service met one of these criteria: served during a war (e.g., World War II: Dec 7, 1941 - Apr 28, 1952); OR served during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955; OR served in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized."` (This refers to OPM Vet Guide, section for Widow/Widower, first bullet point) -> `eligible_xp_derived_widow.md`
*   `"The veteran died while on active duty, AND that active duty included service during a war, or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized, AND the death was under conditions that would not have been the basis for other than an honorable or general discharge."` (This refers to OPM Vet Guide, section for Widow/Widower, second bullet point) -> `eligible_xp_derived_widow.md`
*   `"The veteran's service was after July 1, 1955, AND was NOT in a war, campaign, or expedition for which a campaign medal was authorized (and the veteran did not die on active duty during such specific qualifying service as described above)."` (This likely makes you ineligible based on the OPM Note.) -> `ineligible_derived_widow_vetservicenotqualifying.md`
*   `"None of these conditions seem to apply, or I'm unsure and need to check the veteran's records."` -> `derived_widow_clarify_vetservice.md`
*   `"[Return to previous question (Remarriage Status)]"` -> `derived_widow_remarried.md`
*   `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `start.md`
