# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Based on Your Own Service

You indicated you are seeking preference based on your own service in the U.S. Armed Forces. To help answer the following questions accurately, it would be beneficial to have your DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) or other official service records handy. These documents contain details like your dates of service, character of discharge, and any campaign medals or badges awarded, which are important for determining preference.

For preference purposes, "active duty" typically refers to full-time service in the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard). Specific definitions can apply, especially for Reserve or National Guard service; for instance, "active duty for training" by National Guard or Reserve members typically does not qualify for preference for non-disabled veterans. However, for disabled veterans, "active duty" can include such training service (per the Merit Systems Protection Board decision in *Hesse v. Department of the Army, 104 M.S.P.R. 647 (2007)*, as referenced in the OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference'). This advisor will help clarify based on your responses.

To proceed, please select your current status:

*   [I have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces.](./ownservice_discharged_checkretired.md)
*   [I am currently an active duty service member and expect to be discharged or released from active duty service under honorable conditions within 120 days (and I have or can obtain a certification as described in the VOW Act).](./ownservice_vow_checkretired.md)
*   [None of the above apply to me.](./ineligible_ownservice_status.md)
