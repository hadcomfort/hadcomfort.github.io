# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Based on Your Own Service

You indicated you are seeking preference based on your own service in the U.S. Armed Forces. "Active duty" generally means full-time service in the Armed Forces. It's important to note that, for preference purposes, "active duty for training" by National Guard or Reserve members typically does not qualify for preference for non-disabled veterans. However, for disabled veterans, "active duty" can include training service in the Reserves or National Guard (per the Merit Systems Protection Board decision in *Hesse v. Department of the Army, 104 M.S.P.R. 647 (2007)*, as referenced in the OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference'). The following questions will help clarify your status.

To proceed, please select your current status:

*   [I have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces.](./ownservice_discharged_checkretired.md)
*   [I am currently an active duty service member and expect to be discharged or released from active duty service under honorable conditions within 120 days (and I have or can obtain a certification as described in the VOW Act).](./ownservice_vow_checkretired.md)
*   [None of the above apply to me.](./ineligible_ownservice_status.md)
