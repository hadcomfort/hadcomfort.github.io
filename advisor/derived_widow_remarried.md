# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower): Remarriage Status

You've indicated you were not divorced from the veteran at the time of their death. The next condition for derived preference as a widow/widower, as defined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), relates to your remarriage status.

### OPM Rule on Remarriage

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section defining "Widow/Widower" for preference eligibility, specifies that the individual:

> *"...has not remarried, or the remarriage was annulled..."*

This means that if you have remarried after the veteran's death, that subsequent marriage must have been annulled for you to retain eligibility under this specific condition. If you have not remarried, you meet this condition.

**Have you remarried since the veteran's death?**

*   [Yes, I have remarried, and that marriage was NOT annulled.](./ineligible_derived_widow_remarried.md)
*   [No, I have not remarried SINCE the veteran's death, OR I remarried but that subsequent marriage was annulled.](./derived_widow_vetservice_condition.md)
