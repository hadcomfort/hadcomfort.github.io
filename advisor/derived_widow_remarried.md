# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower): Remarriage Status

You've indicated you were not divorced from the veteran at the time of their death. The next condition for derived preference as a widow/widower relates to your remarriage status.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Widow/Widower," states that to be eligible, the widow or widower:
*"...has not remarried, or the remarriage was annulled..."*

Have you remarried since the veteran's death?

*   `"Yes, I have remarried, and that marriage was NOT annulled."` -> `ineligible_derived_widow_remarried.md`
*   `"No, I have not remarried SINCE the veteran's death, OR I remarried but that subsequent marriage was annulled."` -> `derived_widow_vetservice_condition.md`
*   `"[Return to previous question (Divorce Status)]"` -> `derived_widow_divorced.md`
*   `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `start.md`
