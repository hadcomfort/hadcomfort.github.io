# Mother of Living Disabled Veteran - Veteran's Separation Conditions

You previously indicated that your veteran child is living and 'is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness'.

To be eligible for derived preference as the mother of a living disabled veteran, the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Mother of a disabled veteran," states that the veteran must meet these conditions:
*"...the veteran was separated with an honorable or general discharge from active duty, including training service in the Reserves or National Guard, performed at any time and is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness..."*

Therefore, in addition to being permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness, was your veteran child:
* Separated from active duty (which can include training service in the Reserves or National Guard) with an **honorable or general discharge**?
* Was this active duty performed **at any time** (there are no specific date restrictions for the *service period* itself for mothers of living, disabled veterans, unlike for mothers of deceased veterans)?

* `"Yes, these conditions regarding the veteran's separation and nature of service apply."` -> `advisor/derived_mother_common_fatherinfo.md`
* `"No, one or more of these conditions do not apply (e.g., discharge was not honorable or general, or the disability is not permanent and total)."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_mother_living_vetseparation.md`
* `"[Return to previous question (Veteran's Status)]"` -> `advisor/derived_mother_vetstatus.md`
