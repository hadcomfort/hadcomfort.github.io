# Mother of Living Disabled Veteran - Veteran's Separation Conditions

You previously indicated your veteran child is living and 'is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness'.

For preference eligibility, the OPM Vet Guide (section [146]) further requires that the veteran 'was separated with an honorable or general discharge from active duty, including training service in the Reserves or National Guard, performed at any time'.

Does this description of the veteran's separation and service apply to your child?

* `"Yes, these conditions regarding separation and service apply."` -> `advisor/derived_mother_common_fatherinfo.md`
* `"No, these conditions do not all apply."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_mother_living_vetseparation.md`
* `"[Return to previous question]"` -> `advisor/derived_mother_vetstatus.md`
* `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `advisor/start.md`
