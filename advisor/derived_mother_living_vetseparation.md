# Mother of Living Disabled Veteran - Veteran's Separation Conditions

You previously indicated that your veteran child is living and "is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness."

For you to be eligible for derived preference as the mother of a living disabled veteran, your child's service record must meet specific legal requirements. These conditions relate to the nature of their discharge and the type of service they performed.

The OPM's Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under the section "Mother of a disabled veteran," clarifies these requirements. It states that derived preference can be granted if:
*"...the veteran was separated with an honorable or general discharge from active duty, including training service in the Reserves or National Guard, performed at any time and is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness..."*

Therefore, in addition to being permanently and totally disabled, please confirm the following about your veteran child:

*   **Separation from service:** Was the veteran separated with an **honorable or general discharge**?
    *   To be eligible, the character of the veteran's service must be certified as either "Honorable" or "General." Other types of discharge may not qualify for this benefit.
*   **Nature of Duty:** Was this service considered "active duty"?
    *   For the specific purpose of this derived preference, "active duty" includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard. This is based on the Merit Systems Protection Board decision in *Hesse v. Department of the Army, 104 M.S.P.R. 647 (2007)*.
*   **Service Period:** Was this active duty performed **at any time**?
    *   For mothers of living disabled veterans, there are no specific date restrictions for when the veteran served. This is a key distinction from the rules for mothers of deceased veterans, which have specific service period requirements.

If these conditions regarding the veteran's service are met, you will next be asked about your own eligibility status.

*   [Yes, these conditions regarding the veteran's separation and nature of service apply.](./derived_mother_common_fatherinfo.md)
*   [No, one or more of these conditions do not apply (e.g., discharge was not honorable or general).](./ineligible_derived_mother_living_vetseparation.md)
