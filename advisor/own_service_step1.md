# Veteran's Preference Based on Your Own Service

You indicated you are seeking preference based on your own service in the U.S. Armed Forces.

To proceed, please select your current status:

* **[I have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces.](./own_service_discharged_step2.md)**
    * [cite_start]*This generally requires a discharge or release under honorable conditions (i.e., with an honorable or general discharge)[cite: 27].*

* **[I am currently an active duty service member and expect to be discharged or released from active duty service under honorable conditions within 120 days (or I have a certification saying so).](./own_service_vow_act_step2.md)**
    * [cite_start]*This relates to provisions under the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) to Hire Heroes Act of 2011, which requires Federal agencies to treat certain active duty service members as preference eligibles for appointment purposes, even if they have not yet been discharged or released from active duty[cite: 155]. [cite_start]This often requires a certification that the service member is expected to be discharged or released under honorable conditions within 120 days of the certification[cite: 160].*

* **[None of the above apply to me.](./ineligible_own_service_status.md)**
