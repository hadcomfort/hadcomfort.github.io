# Own Service: 10-Point Preference (XP) - General Disability

You've indicated that you have a present service-connected disability OR are receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pension from the military or the Department of Veterans Affairs, not specifically categorized as 10-20% (CP) or 30%+ (CPS). This status may qualify you for 10-point Veteran's Preference (XP), provided your discharge was (or will be, if the VOW Act applies) under honorable conditions and all other general eligibility requirements are met.

It's important to note that for disabled veterans, active duty includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard.

Please remember that you will need to complete the SF-15 form (Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference).
