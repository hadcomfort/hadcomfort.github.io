title: Sole Survivor Preference: Check DD Form 214 for Discharge Reason
---

Your DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) or other official separation documents should state the specific reason or authority for your discharge. Please review these documents to confirm if the reason was explicitly a 'sole survivorship discharge'.

Once you have this information, please select an option:

Choices:
* "Yes, the reason documented was 'sole survivorship discharge'." -> advisor/ownservice_ssp_familycriteria_info.md
* "No, the reason documented was different or unclear regarding sole survivorship." -> advisor/ineligible_ssp_reason.md
* "[Return to Advisor Start]" -> advisor/start.md
