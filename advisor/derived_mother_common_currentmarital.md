---

Which of the following best describes your current living and marital situation?

*   [cite_start]`"I live with my husband (who is either the veteran's father or my husband through remarriage), and he is totally and permanently disabled."` [cite: 143, 148] -> `eligible_xp_derived_mother.md`
*   [cite_start]`"I am widowed (from the veteran's father or a subsequent husband), divorced, or legally separated (from the veteran's father or a subsequent husband), AND I have not remarried since that specific event of widowhood, divorce, or separation."` (This covers [cite: 144, 149] [cite_start]and the essence of [cite: 145, 150]) -> `eligible_xp_derived_mother.md`
*   `"I am currently married, and my husband is NOT totally and permanently disabled."` -> `ineligible_derived_mother_currentmarital.md`
*   `"None of these situations accurately describe mine."` -> `derived_mother_clarify_currentmarital.md`
