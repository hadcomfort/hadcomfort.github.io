# Mother's Preference - Current Living and Marital Status

You have indicated that you are or were married to the father of the veteran. The next set of conditions for derived preference relates to your current marital and living situation.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals states that, in addition to being married to the father of the veteran, the mother also meets one of the following conditions at the time she claims preference:
*   She *"lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (either the veteran's father or her husband through remarriage); or"*
*   She *"is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and has not remarried; or"*
*   She *"remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when she claims preference."*

Which of these specific OPM-defined situations best describes your current status?

*   [I live with my husband (this can be the veteran's father or my husband through remarriage), and he is totally and permanently disabled.](./eligible_xp_derived_mother.md)
*   [I am widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father AND I have not remarried.](./eligible_xp_derived_mother.md)
*   [I remarried after my connection to the veteran's father ended, but I am now widowed, divorced, or legally separated from that subsequent husband.](./eligible_xp_derived_mother.md)
*   [I am currently married, and my current husband is NOT totally and permanently disabled.](./ineligible_derived_mother_currentmarital.md)
*   [None of these situations accurately describe my current marital or living status, or I need more clarification.](./derived_mother_clarify_currentmarital.md)
