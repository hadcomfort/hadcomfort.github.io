# Mother's Preference - Current Living and Marital Status

The OPM guidelines for a mother's current marital and living status are very specific. Select the option that best describes your situation. For the full OPM text, see the "None of these..." option below. (These options assume you also meet the OPM condition that 'she is or was married to the father of the veteran'.)

Which of the following best describes your current living and marital situation?

*   ["I live with my husband who 'is totally and permanently disabled'. This husband can be the veteran's father or your husband through remarriage." (OPM Vet Guide, sections [143, 148])](./eligible_xp_derived_mother.md)
*   ["I am 'widowed, divorced, or legally separated' (from the veteran's father OR a subsequent husband) AND 'have not remarried' since that event." (This covers OPM Vet Guide, sections [144, 149] and the essence of [145, 150])](./eligible_xp_derived_mother.md)
*   ["I am currently married, and my husband is NOT totally and permanently disabled."](./ineligible_derived_mother_currentmarital.md)
*   ["None of these situations accurately describe mine (see full OPM text here)."](./derived_mother_clarify_currentmarital.md)
