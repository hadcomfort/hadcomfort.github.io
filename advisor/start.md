title: Veteran's Preference Advisor - Start
---

This interactive advisor will guide you through a series of questions to help determine potential eligibility for U.S. Federal employment veteran's preference. Your answers will help navigate the complexities of preference rules.

**Disclaimer:** This advisor provides an initial assessment based on your responses and general OPM guidelines. It is **not an official determination** of veteran's preference. Always refer to official OPM guidance and consult with federal agency HR for definitive answers. For a more detailed disclaimer, please see our [main page disclaimer](../index.md#disclaimer).

Let's determine your potential veteran's preference.
This tool is designed to help you understand potential eligibility for U.S. Federal employment veterans' preference. Please select the primary basis on which you are seeking to determine potential eligibility: (Note: 'Armed Forces' generally means Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2101(2). Specific conditions apply for other uniformed services like NOAA and Public Health Service; see OPM Vet Guide Appendix B for details.)

**Why Your Service Documents Are Important:**
Having your service documents, especially your DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) or other separation documents, readily available will be very helpful. These documents contain key information that this advisor will ask about, such as:
*   **Dates of Service:** Entry and separation dates for periods of active duty.
*   **Character of Service:** The nature of your discharge (e.g., Honorable, General under Honorable Conditions).
*   **Campaign Medals/Badges:** Receipt of specific medals (like the Purple Heart) or expeditionary medals can be crucial for certain preference types.
*   **Service-Connected Disability Information:** If applicable, VA rating letters or other disability documentation will be essential for 10-point preference claims.

For a more detailed list of what might be useful, you can refer to the [Before You Begin section on our homepage](../index.md#before-you-begin).
