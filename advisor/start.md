# Veteran's Preference Advisor

This tool is designed to help you understand potential eligibility for U.S. Federal employment veterans' preference.

Please select the primary basis on which you are seeking to determine potential eligibility:

* **[My own service in the U.S. Armed Forces](./own_service_step1.md)**
    * [cite_start]The U.S. Armed Forces include the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. 
    * [cite_start]This path is for individuals who have been discharged or released from active duty. 
    * [cite_start]Certain active duty service members may also be treated as preference eligibles under the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) Act, even if not yet discharged or released. 

* **[The service of a qualifying veteran, if I am a spouse, widow(er), or mother](./derived_preference_step1.md)**
    * [cite_start]This is known as "derived preference," where eligibility is based on the service of a veteran who may not be able to use the preference themselves. 

* **[Neither of the above](./ineligible_start.md)**
