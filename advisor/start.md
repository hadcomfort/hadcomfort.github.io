# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Start

This tool is designed to help you understand potential eligibility for U.S. Federal employment veterans' preference. Please select the primary basis on which you are seeking to determine potential eligibility: (Note: 'Armed Forces' generally means Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2101(2). Specific conditions apply for other uniformed services like NOAA and Public Health Service; see OPM Vet Guide Appendix B for details.)

This is an unofficial tool and should not be considered a guarantee of eligibility for veterans' preference or any U.S. Federal job. For official guidance, please consult the resources listed on the [About page](advisor/about.md). User selections and other inputs are not saved or shared.
