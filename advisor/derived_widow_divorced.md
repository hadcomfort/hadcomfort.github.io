# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower): Marital Status at Veteran's Death

As a widow or widower of a veteran, you may be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP). One of the initial criteria the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) considers is your marital status with the veteran at the time of their death.

### OPM Rule on Marital Status at Time of Veteran's Death

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section defining "Widow/Widower" for preference eligibility, specifies that the individual:

> *"...was not divorced from the veteran..."*

This is a critical requirement. If you were legally divorced from the veteran when they passed away, you generally do not meet this specific condition for derived preference as a widow/widower.
