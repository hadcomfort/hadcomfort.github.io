# Derived Preference (Widow/Widower): Marital Status at Veteran's Death

As a widow or widower of a veteran, you may be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP). One of the initial criteria concerns your marital status with the veteran at the time of their death.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, under "Widow/Widower," states that to be eligible, the widow or widower of a veteran:
*"...was not divorced from the veteran..."*

Were you divorced from the veteran at the time of their death?

*   `"Yes, I was divorced from the veteran at the time of their death."` -> `ineligible_derived_widow_divorced.md`
*   `"No, I was not divorced from the veteran at the time of their death."` -> `derived_widow_remarried.md`
*   `"[Return to Relationship Choice (e.g., if you are not a widow/widower)]"` -> `derived_intro.md`
*   `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `start.md`
