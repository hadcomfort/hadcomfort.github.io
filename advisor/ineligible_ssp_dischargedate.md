# Ineligible for Sole Survivor Preference: Discharge Date Not Met

To be eligible for Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP) under the Hubbard Act, your release or discharge from active duty must have occurred **after August 29, 2008** (OPM Vet Guide, '0-point Preference (SSP)').

Based on your response, your discharge date does not meet this requirement for SSP. You may still be eligible for other types of veteran's preference based on your service.
