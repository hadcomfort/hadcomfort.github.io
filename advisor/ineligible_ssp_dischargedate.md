# Sole Survivor Preference - Ineligible: Discharge Date Requirement Not Met

Based on your response, your date of release or discharge from active duty does not meet the specific requirement for Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP).

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section "0-point Preference (SSP)," explains the Hubbard Act:
> The Hubbard Act amended the eligibility categories for veterans’ preference purposes by adding subparagraph (H) to 5 U.S.C. 2108(3). Subparagraph (H) establishes a new veterans’ preference eligibility category for veterans released or discharged from a period of active duty from the armed forces, **after August 29, 2008**, by reason of a “sole survivorship discharge.”
(emphasis added)

If your discharge was on or before August 29, 2008, you are not eligible for Sole Survivorship Preference under this provision. You may still be eligible for other types of veteran's preference (e.g., 5-point or 10-point disability preference) based on other aspects of your service.
