title: Sole Survivor Preference: Potentially Ineligible - Discharge Date Not Met
---

To be eligible for 0-point Sole Survivor Preference (SSP) under the Hubbard Act, your release or discharge from active duty must have occurred *after August 29, 2008*.

Based on your response, your discharge date does not meet this requirement for SSP. You may still be eligible for other types of veteran's preference based on your service.

Choices:
* "[Re-check discharge date information]" -> advisor/ownservice_ssp_dischargedate.md
* "[Explore other preference types (e.g., 5-point, disability)]" -> advisor/ownservice_checkdisability_intro.md
* "[Return to Advisor Start]" -> advisor/start.md
