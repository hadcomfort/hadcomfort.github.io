# Sole Survivor Preference - Ineligible: Reason for Discharge Not "Sole Survivorship"

Based on your response, the reason for your discharge from active duty was not a "sole survivorship discharge."

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals, in the section "0-point Preference (SSP)," explains that eligibility for this preference category is for:
> "...veterans released or discharged from a period of active duty from the armed forces, after August 29, 2008, **by reason of a “sole survivorship discharge.”**" (emphasis added)

If your discharge was for reasons other than a "sole survivorship discharge," you are not eligible for Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP), even if your discharge occurred after August 29, 2008.

You may still be eligible for other types of veteran's preference (e.g., 5-point or 10-point disability preference) based on other aspects of your service.
