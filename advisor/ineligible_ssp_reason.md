title: Sole Survivor Preference: Potentially Ineligible - Reason for Discharge Not Met
---

[cite_start]Eligibility for 0-point Sole Survivor Preference (SSP) requires that the specific reason for your discharge (after August 29, 2008) was a 'sole survivorship discharge'.[cite_end]

If your discharge was for other reasons, you would not qualify for SSP. However, you might be eligible for other types of veteran's preference (e.g., 5-point preference based on service period or campaign medal, or 10-point preference if disabled).

Choices:
* "[Re-check reason for discharge information]" -> advisor/ownservice_ssp_discharge_reason.md
* "[Explore other preference types (e.g., 5-point, disability)]" -> advisor/ownservice_checkdisability_intro.md
* "[Return to Advisor Start]" -> advisor/start.md
