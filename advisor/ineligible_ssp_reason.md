# Ineligible for Sole Survivor Preference: Reason for Discharge Not Met

Eligibility for Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP) requires that the specific reason for your discharge (after August 29, 2008) was a **"sole survivorship discharge"** (OPM Vet Guide, '0-point Preference (SSP)').

If your discharge was for other reasons, you would not qualify for SSP based on this specific provision. However, you might be eligible for other types of veteran's preference.
