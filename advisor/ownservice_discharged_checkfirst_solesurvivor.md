title: "Own Service: Check for Sole Survivorship Preference"
---

You've indicated no current claim to disability/Purple Heart preference. Now we need to determine other types of preference you might be eligible for.

The Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP) is a specific type of preference. Let's check if this might apply to you.

First, were you released or discharged from active duty **after August 29, 2008**, AND was the discharge specifically by reason of a **'sole survivorship discharge'**? (This is often noted on your DD Form 214. See OPM Vet Guide, '0-point Preference (SSP)').

* [No, these conditions do not apply, or I'm not sure.]({{ site.baseurl }}/advisor/ownservice_nodisability_nossps_checkserviceperiod.md)
