title: Own Service: WWII Service for 5-Point Preference
---

You indicated service during World War II (December 7, 1941 - April 28, 1952). This service qualifies for 5-point preference (TP), provided your discharge was honorable and other general conditions are met. The 24-month minimum service rule generally does not apply to this period for establishing preference eligibility (OPM Vet Guide, '5-Point Preference (TP)').
