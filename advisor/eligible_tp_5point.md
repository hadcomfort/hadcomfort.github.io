# Veteran's Preference Advisor - Potential 5-Point Eligibility (TP)

Based on your responses, you appear to meet the criteria for 5-point veteran's preference (TP), provided your discharge was (or will be, if VOW Act applies) under honorable conditions and all other general eligibility requirements are met. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide specifies that this preference is generally for veterans who served "During a war; or During the period April 28, 1952 through July 1, 1955; or For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976; or During the Gulf War from August 2, 1990, through January 2, 1992; or For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred during the period beginning September 11, 2001, and ending on August 31, 2010...; or In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized." This is an initial assessment and not a final determination of preference. This preference means that 5 points are added to your passing score on a civil service examination. (OPM Vet Guide, '5-Point Preference (TP)') Remember to claim preference when applying for Federal jobs and be prepared to provide necessary documentation (like your DD Form 214 or VOW Act certification).
