# Derived Preference (Mother) - Veteran's Status (Deceased or Living Disabled)

As a mother, you may be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals states: *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."*

The Vet Guide further clarifies: *"Both a mother and a spouse (including widow or widower) may be entitled to preference on the basis of the same veteran's service if they both meet the requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."*

This page will help determine if the veteran's status (your son or daughter on whose service you are basing your claim) makes you potentially eligible. Is the veteran:

* `"Deceased."` (See OPM Vet Guide, "Mother of a deceased veteran") -> `advisor/derived_mother_deceased_vetdeathcond.md`
* `"Living AND is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness."` (See OPM Vet Guide, "Mother of a disabled veteran" [section 146]) -> `advisor/derived_mother_living_vetseparation.md`
* `"Neither of these apply / I'm unsure (e.g., veteran is living but not qualified for Federal employment due to reasons other than permanent and total service-connected disability, or veteran is living and qualified)."` -> `advisor/ineligible_derived_mother_vetstatus.md`
* `"[Return to Relationship Choice]"` -> `advisor/derived_intro.md`
