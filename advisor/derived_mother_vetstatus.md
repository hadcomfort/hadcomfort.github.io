# Derived Preference (Mother) - Veteran's Status (Deceased or Living Disabled)

As the mother of a veteran, you may be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP). This is a significant benefit designed to honor the sacrifice of veterans who are unable to use their earned preference themselves.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals explains the core concept of derived preference:

> *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."*

### Understanding the Core Principle

The fundamental rule for derived preference is that it is only available if the veteran is unable to use their own preference for Federal employment. This occurs in two primary scenarios:

1.  The veteran is **deceased**.
2.  The veteran is **living** but has a **permanent and total service-connected disability**, which makes them unable to work and use their preference.

The OPM Vet Guide also clarifies that eligibility can extend to both a mother and a spouse simultaneously, provided they both independently meet all criteria:

> *"Both a mother and a spouse (including widow or widower) may be entitled to preference on the basis of the same veteran's service if they both meet the requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."*

### Key Eligibility Factors

Your eligibility for derived preference depends on several factors. This page focuses on the first and most critical factor: the veteran's current status. However, it is helpful to be aware of other requirements that will be addressed in later steps.

*   **The Veteran's Status (This Page):** The veteran's current condition (living or deceased) and their service-connected disability rating are the initial gateway to determining eligibility.
*   **The Mother's Marital and Financial Status (Future Steps):** To qualify, the mother of the veteran must also meet specific conditions related to her own status. You will be asked about this later, but generally you must be:
    *   A widow; OR
    *   Married to a person who is permanently and totally disabled; OR
    *   Divorced, separated, or legally widowed and not remarried.

This page will help determine if the veteran's status (your son or daughter on whose service you are basing your claim) makes you potentially eligible.

**To proceed, please select the option that best describes the status of the veteran:**

*   [**Deceased**](./derived_mother_deceased_vetdeathcond.md)
    <br>*(The veteran is deceased. The specific circumstances of their death will be addressed in the next step.)*

*   [**Living AND is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness.**](./derived_mother_living_vetseparation.md)
    <br>*(This means the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or a branch of the Armed Forces has certified that the veteran is unemployable due to their service-connected condition.)*

*   [**Neither of these apply / I'm unsure**](./ineligible_derived_mother_vetstatus.md)
    <br>*(Select this if the veteran is living and does not have a permanent and total service-connected disability, if the veteran is living and qualified for Federal employment, or if you are unsure of their disability status.)*
