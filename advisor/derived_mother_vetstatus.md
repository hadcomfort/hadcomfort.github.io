# Derived Preference (Mother) - Veteran's Status (Deceased or Living Disabled)

As a mother, you may be eligible for 10-point derived veteran's preference (XP). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Vet Guide for HR Professionals states: *"Ten points are added to the passing examination score or rating of spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans as described below. This type of preference is usually referred to as "derived preference" because it is based on service of a veteran who is not able to use the preference."*

The Vet Guide further clarifies: *"Both a mother and a spouse (including widow or widower) may be entitled to preference on the basis of the same veteran's service if they both meet the requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."*

The veteran's current status (e.g., living or deceased) and their service-connected disability status (if applicable and living) are key factors in determining the specific type of derived preference a mother may be eligible for, and the subsequent questions you will be asked. For example, if the veteran is living, their disability must generally be "permanent and total" for the mother to potentially qualify. Further clarification on such terms will be provided in subsequent steps as needed.
