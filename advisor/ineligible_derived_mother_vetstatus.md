# Mother's Preference - Ineligible Based on Veteran's Status

Based on your response, the status of the veteran (your son or daughter) does not appear to meet the fundamental requirements for you to claim 10-point derived preference (XP) as a mother.

The OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals specifies that for a mother to be eligible, the veteran must meet particular conditions.
> For a **"Mother of a deceased veteran,"** the veteran must have *"died under honorable conditions while on active duty during a war or during the period April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized."* (Additional service limitations apply, e.g., post-1955 service not in a war/campaign).
> For a **"Mother of a disabled veteran,"** the veteran must be *"permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness"* and have been *"separated with an honorable or general discharge from active duty..."*

Furthermore, a general condition for derived preference, as stated in the "10-Point Derived Preference (XP)" section of the Vet Guide, is that:
> *"neither [a mother nor a spouse] may receive preference if the veteran is living and is qualified for Federal employment."*

Therefore, if the veteran:
*   Is deceased but did not die under the specific qualifying service conditions outlined, OR
*   Is living but is not permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness, OR
*   Is living and IS qualified for Federal employment,

then the mother is generally not eligible for derived preference. Your responses suggest one or more of these ineligibility conditions may apply.
