title: Mother's Preference - Potentially Ineligible - Veteran's Status
---

To be eligible for derived preference as a mother, the veteran (your son or daughter) must generally be either:
1. [cite_start]Deceased under specific conditions related to their active duty service (during a war, specific period, or campaign)[cite: 141], OR
2. [cite_start]Living and permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness, and honorably separated[cite: 146].

Based on your response, the veteran's status may not meet these requirements.

*   `"[Return to check veteran's status]"` -> `derived_mother_vetstatus.md`
*   `"[Return to Relationship Choice]"` -> `derived_intro.md`
*   `"[Return to Advisor Start]"` -> `start.md`
