# Mother's Preference - Potentially Ineligible - Veteran's Status

To be eligible for derived preference as a mother, the veteran (your son or daughter) must generally be either:
1. Deceased under specific conditions related to their active duty service (during a war, specific period, or campaign) (OPM Vet Guide, section [141]), OR
2. Living and permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury or illness, and honorably separated (OPM Vet Guide, section [146]).

Based on your response, the veteran's status may not meet these requirements.
