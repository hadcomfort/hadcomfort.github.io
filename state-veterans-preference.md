# State-Level Veterans' Preference Rules

While federal veteran's preference is standardized, the rules for preference in state, county, and municipal government employment vary significantly from state to state. Each state has its own laws and regulations that define who is eligible, what type of preference is granted (e.g., points added to exam scores, absolute preference), and how to apply.

This section provides a central resource for understanding the specific veterans' preference rules for each U.S. state and territory.

**Disclaimer:** This information is a summary for informational purposes and is subject to change. State laws can be amended. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, you must consult the official state government resources linked on each individual state's page.
