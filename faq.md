# Frequently Asked Questions

This page answers common questions about Veteran's Preference and special appointing authorities for veterans in federal hiring. The information is based on the OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals and related guidance.

## What are the main special appointing authorities available to help veterans get federal jobs?

There are several key authorities:
*   **Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA):** Allows agencies to non-competitively appoint eligible veterans to positions up to GS-11 or equivalent.
*   **30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans:** Enables agencies to make non-competitive temporary or term appointments to veterans with a VA disability rating of 30% or more, which can be converted to permanent.
*   **Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program:** Facilitates work experience and training for disabled veterans in federal agencies, potentially leading to a non-competitive appointment after program completion.
*   **Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA):** Permits preference eligibles and certain other veterans to apply for federal jobs announced under merit promotion procedures that are not open to the general public.

Each authority has specific eligibility requirements and procedures. You can find more details on the [Special Appointing Authorities for Veterans](special_appointing_authorities.md) page.

## How does the Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) differ from VEOA?

VRA and VEOA are distinct authorities that help veterans in different ways:
*   **VRA (Veterans Recruitment Appointment):** This is an excepted service appointing authority (see 5 CFR Part 307) that allows agencies to appoint eligible veterans to positions up to GS-11 (or equivalent) *without competition*. Eligibility for VRA includes being a disabled veteran, serving during a war or in a campaign for which a medal was awarded, receiving an Armed Forces Service Medal, or being a "recently separated veteran." After two years of satisfactory service, a VRA appointee must be converted to a career or career-conditional appointment.
*   **VEOA (Veterans Employment Opportunities Act):** This authority (see 5 U.S.C. § 3304) allows preference eligibles and other eligible veterans (generally those with 3 or more years of continuous active service) to *compete* for positions announced under merit promotion procedures when an agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce. It's not a non-competitive authority, and veterans' preference points (5 or 10 points) are not applied as they are in competitive examinations. If selected under VEOA, the appointment is to a career or career-conditional position.

In short, VRA is a non-competitive hiring path for specific roles, while VEOA provides broader access to compete for jobs that might otherwise be restricted to current federal employees.

## Can I be appointed non-competitively if I have a significant disability?

Yes, there are specific authorities for this:
*   **30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans:** This authority (5 U.S.C. § 3112) allows agencies to give a non-competitive temporary appointment (longer than 60 days) or a term appointment to veterans who retired from active military service with a disability rating of 30% or more, or who have a VA rating of a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more. These appointments can be converted to career or career-conditional status at any time.
*   **Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program:** Veterans eligible for training under the VA vocational rehabilitation program (38 U.S.C. § Chapter 31) can be placed in a federal agency for work experience or training. Upon successful completion, the agency and VA issue a Certificate of Training, which allows any agency to appoint the veteran non-competitively. This appointment may also be converted to career or career-conditional.

These authorities are designed to provide a direct path to federal employment for veterans with significant disabilities.

## How is "war" defined for preference purposes?

For veteran's preference purposes, "war" means only those armed conflicts declared by Congress as war. This includes World War II (December 7, 1941, to April 28, 1952). 38 U.S.C. § defines "period of war" to include many non-declared wars for VA benefits, but this definition is NOT applicable for civil service preference purposes. (OPM Vet Guide, 'Introduction')

## What's the difference between 5-point and 10-point preference?

When using a numerical ranking process for competitive examinations, eligible veterans can have 5 or 10 points added to their passing examination score or rating.

**5-Point Preference (TP):** Five points are added for veterans who served:
* During a war; or
* During the period April 28, 1952 through July 1, 1955; or
* For more than 180 consecutive days (other than for training) any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976; or
* During the Gulf War from August 2, 1990, through January 2, 1992; or
* For more than 180 consecutive days (other than for training) any part of which occurred during the period beginning September 11, 2001, and ending on August 31, 2010 (last day of Operation Iraqi Freedom); or
* In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized.

A campaign medal holder or Gulf War veteran who originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, (or began active duty on or after October 14, 1982, and had not previously completed 24 months of continuous active duty) must have served continuously for 24 months or the full period for which called or ordered to active duty. **Importantly, this 24-month service requirement does not apply to 10-point preference eligibles, particularly those separated for a service-connected disability (incurred or aggravated in the line of duty) or to veterans separated for hardship or other reasons under 10 U.S.C. § 1171 or § 1173.**

**10-Point Preference:** Ten points are added for:
* **Compensable Disability Preference (CP):** Veterans with a compensable service-connected disability rating of at least 10% but less than 30%.
* **30 Percent Compensable Disability Preference (CPS):** Veterans with a compensable service-connected disability rating of 30% or more.
* **Disability Preference (XP):** Veterans with a present service-connected disability or receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pension from the military or VA (who don't qualify as CP or CPS), or veterans who received a Purple Heart.
* **Derived Preference (XP):** Spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans under specific conditions, as this preference is derived from a veteran unable to use it.

Applicants claiming 10-point preference must complete Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, and submit required documentation. (OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference')

## How does preference apply in Reductions in Force (RIF)?

Veterans have advantages over non-veterans in a Reduction in Force (RIF). Employees are ranked on retention registers based on tenure, veteran's preference, length of service, and performance.

Within each tenure group (I, II, or III), employees are placed in subgroups:
* **Subgroup AD:** Preference eligibles with a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more.
* **Subgroup A:** All other preference eligibles (including derived preference).
* **Subgroup B:** Non-preference eligibles.

Within each subgroup, employees are ranked by length of creditable service, augmented by performance ratings. Because veterans are listed ahead of non-veterans within each tenure group, they are the last to be affected by a RIF.

Special provisions apply to retired military members regarding preference eligibility and service credit in RIFs. (OPM Vet Guide, 'Veterans' Preference in Reduction in Force')

## What if I don't have my DD Form 214?

The VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allows active duty service members who are within 120 days of discharge to apply for federal jobs using a "certification" in lieu of a DD Form 214.

A "certification" is any written document from the armed forces that certifies the service member is expected to be discharged or released from active duty service under honorable conditions within 120 days after the certification is submitted. The certification letter should be on letterhead of the appropriate military branch and contain (1) the military service dates including the expected discharge or release date; and (2) the character of service.

Agencies are required to accept, process, and grant tentative veterans’ preference to those active duty service members who submit such a certification. However, agencies must verify the individual meets the definition of ‘preference eligible’ under 5 U.S.C. § 2108 prior to appointment, which may involve providing the DD Form 214 after it is issued.

If an applicant is claiming preference based on service (e.g., in Bosnia) and does not have a DD Form 214 to support the claim, tentative preference may be accorded, but proof of entitlement (like an amended DD Form 214 or other official documentation) must be submitted before appointment. (OPM Vet Guide, 'A word about the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act' and 'Questions and Answers about Gulf War Preference')

## What is "derived preference"?

Derived preference (a type of 10-point XP preference) is granted to spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans under specific circumstances. This preference is "derived" because it's based on the service of a veteran who is unable to use the preference themselves.

Eligibility for derived preference depends on factors such as:
* **For a spouse:** The veteran must be disqualified for a federal position along the lines of their usual occupation due to a service-connected disability (e.g., rated 100% disabled/unemployable, retired from civil service due to service-connected disability, or failed to qualify for jobs due to it).
* **For a widow/widower:** The veteran must not have been divorced from the individual, the individual must not have remarried (or the remarriage was annulled), and the veteran's service must meet certain criteria (e.g., served during a war, specific periods, or in a campaign for which a medal was authorized, or died on active duty under qualifying conditions).
* **For a mother of a deceased veteran:** The veteran must have died under honorable conditions on active duty during specific periods or campaigns, and the mother must meet certain marital and dependency criteria (e.g., lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband, or is widowed/divorced and not remarried).
* **For a mother of a living disabled veteran:** The veteran must have been separated honorably and be permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury/illness, and the mother must meet similar marital and dependency criteria as for the mother of a deceased veteran.

Both a mother and a spouse may be entitled to preference based on the same veteran's service if they both meet the requirements. However, neither may receive preference if the veteran is living and qualified for federal employment. (OPM Vet Guide, '10-Point Derived Preference (XP)')

## Does preference apply to all federal jobs?

No, preference does not apply to all federal jobs.

**Preference DOES apply to:**
* Permanent and temporary positions in the competitive and excepted services of the executive branch.
* Hiring from civil service examinations conducted by OPM and agencies under delegated examining authority.
* Most excepted service jobs, including Veterans Recruitment Appointments (VRA).
* When agencies make temporary, term, and overseas limited appointments.

**Preference DOES NOT apply to:**
* Positions in the Senior Executive Service (SES).
* Executive branch positions for which Senate confirmation is required.
* Positions in the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government, unless the positions are in the competitive service (e.g., Government Printing Office) or have been made subject to the Veterans' Preference Act by another law.
* Promotions, reassignments, changes to lower grade, transfers, or reinstatements.

Agencies have broad authority to hire from any appropriate source of eligibles, including special appointing authorities, and are required to give priority to displaced employees before using civil service examinations. (OPM Vet Guide, 'When Preference Applies')

## What is 0-point "Sole Survivorship Preference" (SSP)?

Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP) is a type of veteran's preference established by the Hubbard Act (Public Law 110-317) for veterans released or discharged from active duty after August 29, 2008, by reason of a "sole survivorship discharge."

Under this preference, the individual:
* Does not receive numerical points (like 5 or 10 points) added to their score.
* Is entitled to be listed ahead of non-preference eligibles with the same score on an examination, or listed ahead of non-preference eligibles in the same quality category when agencies use category rating.
* Is entitled to the same pass over rights as other preference eligibles.
* Is entitled to credit experience in the armed forces to meet qualification requirements.

This preference applies to the only surviving child in a family where the father, mother, or one or more siblings served in the armed forces and was killed, died as a result of wounds/accident/disease, is in a captured/missing in action status, or is permanently 100% disabled or hospitalized (and not gainfully employed due to it), where the death, status, or disability was not due to intentional misconduct or willful neglect and not incurred during unauthorized absence. (OPM Vet Guide, 'Types of Preference', '0-point Preference (SSP)')

## Are "Man-Day Tours" considered active duty for preference?

Yes, "Man-Day Tours," also known as active duty in support (ADS), are generally considered regular active duty for preference purposes if the individual was awarded a campaign or expeditionary medal (like the Southwest Asia Service Medal - SWASM) or served during a qualifying period (e.g., August 2, 1990, to January 2, 1992, for Gulf War preference).

This service is often funded from a military appropriation account (MPA) and supports short-term active force needs. Federal agencies should treat man-day tours as regular active duty unless there is a clear indication on the orders that it was active duty *for training*. A reservist performing active duty for training would typically not be eligible for a campaign or expeditionary medal. (OPM Vet Guide, 'A Word about Man-Day Tours')
