# Frequently Asked Questions

This page answers common questions about Veteran's Preference and special appointing authorities for veterans in federal hiring. The information is based on the [OPM Vet Guide for HR Professionals](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/) and related guidance.

*The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance reflects that as a result of the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in United States v. Windsor, which struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), legally married same-sex spouses are eligible for federal benefits, including those related to veterans' preference where spousal eligibility is a factor (e.g., derived preference), regardless of state of residency.*

## General Information About Veterans' Preference

### What is Veterans' Preference?
Veterans' Preference gives eligible veterans a special advantage over other applicants in the competitive hiring process for Federal jobs. It also provides protections in retention during reductions in force (RIF). It is not a guarantee of a job. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Introduction' and 'Chapter 2: Why Preference is Given').

### Why is Veterans' Preference given?
Since the Civil War, veterans have been given some preference in Federal appointments. It recognizes their sacrifice, aims to prevent penalization for time in military service, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position, and acknowledges the obligation owed to disabled veterans. The current form largely stems from the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Why Preference is Given').

### What does "Armed Forces" mean for preference purposes?
As defined in 5 U.S.C. 2101(2), "Armed Forces" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference').

### How is "war" defined for preference purposes under Title 5?
For Title 5 veteran's preference purposes in Federal employment, OPM has always interpreted "war" to mean a war declared by Congress. This includes World War II (December 7, 1941, to April 28, 1952). This is different from the Title 38 definition of "period of war" used for VA benefits, which includes non-declared wars like Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Introduction' and 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference, For purposes of this chapter...').

### Is active duty for training qualifying for preference?
*   **For non-disabled veterans:** Active duty for training by National Guard or Reserve members generally does *not* qualify as "active duty" for preference purposes.
*   **For disabled veterans:** Active duty *includes* training service in the Reserves or National Guard, per the Merit Systems Protection Board decision in Hesse v. Department of the Army, 104 M.S.P.R.647(2007).
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference').

### Are military retirees eligible for preference in appointment?
Military retirees at the rank of major, lieutenant commander, or higher are *not* eligible for preference in appointment *unless* they are disabled veterans. This restriction does not apply to Reservists who will not begin drawing military retired pay until age 60. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference'). For RIF purposes, there are different rules. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 3: Eligibility for Veterans' Preference in RIF').

---

## Applicability of Preference

### When does Veterans' Preference apply in hiring?
Preference in hiring applies to:
*   Permanent and temporary positions in the competitive and excepted services of the executive branch.
*   Hiring from civil service examinations conducted by OPM and agencies under delegated examining authority.
*   Most excepted service jobs, including Veterans Recruitment Appointments (VRA) if there's more than one VRA candidate and one is preference eligible.
*   When agencies make temporary, term, and overseas limited appointments.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: When Preference Applies').

### When does Veterans' Preference NOT apply?
Preference does NOT apply to:
*   Positions in the Senior Executive Service (SES).
*   Executive branch positions for which Senate confirmation is required.
*   Positions in the legislative and judicial branches (unless the positions are in the competitive service or made subject to the Act by another law).
*   Promotions, reassignments, changes to lower grade, transfers, or reinstatements.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: When Preference Applies').

### Does preference guarantee a job?
No. Veterans' preference does not guarantee a job. It provides an advantage in the application and selection process but does not compel an agency to hire a veteran if other candidates are deemed better qualified, subject to pass-over rules. Agencies also have broad authority to hire from various sources. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: When Preference Applies').

---

## Types of Preference

### What documentation is generally needed to claim preference?
To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions (i.e., with an honorable or general discharge). Eligible veterans should claim preference on their application or resume.
*   **For 10-point preference:** Applicants must complete Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, and submit the requested documentation (e.g., DD Form 214, VA letters).
*   **For 5-point preference:** The DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) or other official proof of service showing dates and character of service is typically required.
*   **VOW Act:** Active duty members nearing separation can use a "certification" letter.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference' and 'A word about the VOW Act').

### What is 0-point Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP)?
Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP), established by the Hubbard Act, is for veterans released/discharged after August 29, 2008, due to a "sole survivorship discharge."
Under SSP, the individual:
*   Does not receive numerical preference points (0 points).
*   Is listed ahead of non-preference eligibles with the same score (or in the same quality category under category rating).
*   Has the same pass-over rights as other preference eligibles.
*   Can credit armed forces experience towards qualifications.
This preference applies to the only surviving child in a family where a parent or sibling died or is permanently 100% disabled due to service, under specific conditions. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference, 0-point Preference (SSP)').

### What is 5-Point Preference (TP)?
Five points are added to the passing examination score or rating of a veteran who served:
*   During a war; or
*   During April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955; or
*   For more than 180 consecutive days (other than for training), any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976; or
*   During the Gulf War (August 2, 1990, through January 2, 1992); or
*   For more than 180 consecutive days (other than for training), any part of which occurred between September 11, 2001, and August 31, 2010 (end of Operation Iraqi Freedom); or
*   In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign medal has been authorized (e.g., El Salvador, Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Southwest Asia, Somalia, Haiti).
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference, 5-Point Preference (TP)').

### What is the 24-month service requirement for 5-point preference, and are there exceptions?
A campaign medal holder or Gulf War veteran who originally enlisted after September 7, 1980 (or began active duty on or after October 14, 1982, without previously completing 24 months of continuous active duty) must have served continuously for 24 months or the full period called/ordered to active duty to receive 5-point preference.
**Exceptions:** This 24-month service requirement *does not apply* to:
*   10-point preference eligibles separated for disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.
*   Veterans separated for hardship or other reasons under 10 U.S.C. 1171 or 1173.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference, 5-Point Preference (TP)').

### What are the different types of 10-Point Preference?
Ten points are added to a passing score for veterans who qualify for:
*   **Compensable Disability Preference (CP):** Service-connected disability of 10% to less than 30%.
*   **30 Percent Compensable Disability Preference (CPS):** Service-connected disability of 30% or more.
*   **Disability Preference (XP):** Non-compensable service-connected disability, or receiving VA pension/disability retirement, or received a Purple Heart.
*   **Derived Preference (XP):** Granted to certain spouses, widows/widowers, or mothers of eligible veterans.
Applicants for 10-point preference must complete SF-15 and provide supporting documentation. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference' sections for CP, CPS, XP).

### Who qualifies for 10-Point Compensable Disability Preference (CP)?
A veteran who served at any time and who has a compensable service-connected disability rating of at least 10 percent but less than 30 percent. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference, 10-Point Compensable Disability Preference (CP)').

### Who qualifies for 10-Point 30 Percent Compensable Disability Preference (CPS)?
A veteran who served at any time and who has a compensable service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference, 10-Point 30 Percent Compensable Disability Preference (CPS)').

### Who qualifies for 10-Point Disability Preference (XP) (non-compensable or Purple Heart)?
This preference (XP) is for:
*   A veteran who served at any time and has a present service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pension from the military or VA but does not qualify as CP or CPS; OR
*   A veteran who received a Purple Heart.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference, 10-Point Disability Preference (XP)').

### What is "derived preference" (XP for relatives)?
Derived preference (also a type of 10-point XP preference) is granted to spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans under specific conditions. It's "derived" because it's based on the service of a veteran who cannot use the preference. Both a mother and a spouse (including widow or widower) may be entitled if they both meet requirements, but not if the veteran is living and qualified for Federal employment. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference, 10-Point Derived Preference (XP)').

### Who is eligible for derived preference as a spouse?
The spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability. Disqualification may be presumed if the veteran is unemployed AND:
*   Is rated 100% disabled and/or unemployable by military/VA; OR
*   Retired/resigned from civil service due to a service-connected disability; OR
*   Tried and failed to qualify for civil service or similar jobs due to a service-connected disability.
This is different from the DoD spousal preference for active-duty members' spouses. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: 10-Point Derived Preference (XP), Spouse').

### Who is eligible for derived preference as a widow/widower?
The widow or widower of a veteran who:
*   Was not divorced from the veteran; AND
*   Has not remarried, or the remarriage was annulled; AND
*   The veteran either:
    *   Served during a war, or April 28, 1952 - July 1, 1955, or in a campaign/expedition with an authorized medal; OR
    *   Died on active duty (that included such service) under conditions that would have been honorable or general discharge.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: 10-Point Derived Preference (XP), Widow/Widower').

### Who is eligible for derived preference as a mother of a deceased veteran?
The mother of a veteran who died under honorable conditions on active duty during a war, or April 28, 1952 - July 1, 1955, or in a campaign/expedition with an authorized medal; AND
*   She is or was married to the father of the veteran; AND
*   She lives with her totally and permanently disabled husband (veteran's father or remarried husband); OR
*   She is widowed, divorced, or separated from the veteran's father and hasn't remarried; OR
*   She remarried but is widowed, divorced, or legally separated from her husband when claiming preference.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: 10-Point Derived Preference (XP), Mother of a deceased veteran').

### Who is eligible for derived preference as a mother of a disabled veteran?
The mother of a living disabled veteran if the veteran was separated honorably (including training service) and is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected injury/illness; AND the mother meets the same marital/dependency criteria as for the mother of a deceased veteran. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: 10-Point Derived Preference (XP), Mother of a disabled veteran').

### Are all campaign medals qualifying for preference?
No. Only specific campaign or expeditionary medals authorized by the Armed Forces qualify for veterans' preference. Medals for non-combat operations or general service (e.g., Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (for general service, not specific campaigns), National Defense Service Medal, Antarctica Service Medal, Armed Forces Service Medal for non-hostile operations) are generally *not* a basis for preference. The DD Form 214 must show award of a qualifying Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal or other specific campaign medal. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'VetGuide Appendix A: Wars, Campaigns and Expeditions').

### What is the difference between Title 5 and Title 38 definitions of "war"?
This is a critical and often confusing distinction.
*   **Title 5, U.S. Code** governs Federal employment and veteran's preference. For Title 5 purposes, OPM has always interpreted "war" to mean only an armed conflict for which Congress has passed a formal declaration of war. The last such declared war was World War II (December 7, 1941, to April 28, 1952).
*   **Title 38, U.S. Code** governs benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), such as healthcare and disability compensation. Title 38 defines "period of war" much more broadly to include non-declared conflicts like the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam Era, and the Persian Gulf War.

**Why it matters:** A veteran might be eligible for VA benefits under Title 38 for service during the Vietnam Era but may *not* be eligible for 5-point veteran's preference under Title 5 based on that service alone (unless they also received a qualifying campaign medal). This website's Advisor focuses on the Title 5 definitions for federal employment preference. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Introduction').

## Application Process and Documentation

### How do I claim preference on my application?
Eligible veterans should claim preference on their application or resume.
*   If claiming 5-point preference, you'll typically need to provide your DD Form 214 or equivalent.
*   If claiming 10-point preference, you must complete Standard Form (SF) 15, "Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference," and submit it with your DD Form 214 and any other required proof (like a VA disability letter).
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Types of Preference').

### What if I am an active duty service member soon to be discharged and don't have my DD Form 214? (VOW Act)
The Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allows active duty service members who are expected to be discharged or released under honorable conditions within 120 days to apply for federal jobs using a "certification" instead of a DD Form 214.
The certification must be a written document from the armed forces, on official letterhead, stating:
1.  Military service dates, including the expected discharge/release date.
2.  The character of service.
Agencies must accept this certification, process the application, and grant tentative preference. However, the DD Form 214 must be provided to verify eligibility before appointment. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: A word about the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) Act').

### Can I file a late application for a federal job if I am a preference eligible?
Yes, under certain circumstances:
*   **10-point preference eligibles:** May file an application at any time for positions filled from a register (must be added) or through case examining (agency must retain application for future vacancies for up to three years if no immediate opening).
*   **Other preference eligibles:** May file late applications under more limited conditions, such as if they resigned from a career/career-conditional appointment without delinquency and apply within 90 days, or were unable to file due to active duty.
Agencies are responsible for accepting and considering these applications. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Filing Late Applications').

### Are "Man-Day Tours" considered active duty for preference?
Yes, "Man-Day Tours," also known as active duty in support (ADS), are generally treated as regular active duty for preference purposes, especially if the individual was awarded a qualifying campaign medal (like the Southwest Asia Service Medal - SWASM) or served during a qualifying period (e.g., Gulf War). Agencies should treat these as regular active duty unless orders clearly state it was "active duty for training." (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: A Word about Man-Day Tours').

### How is military experience credited when evaluating qualifications?
An examining office must credit a preference eligible's Armed Forces service as:
*   An extension of the work performed immediately prior to service; OR
*   On the basis of actual duties performed in the service; OR
*   As a combination of both, whichever most benefits the preference eligible.
All applicants receive credit for job-related experience, paid and unpaid. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Crediting Experience of Preference Eligibles').

### Are there waivers for physical qualifications for preference eligibles?
Yes. In determining qualifications, agencies must waive a medical standard or physical requirement if there is sufficient evidence that the applicant or employee, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential duties of the position without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others. Special provisions apply for disqualifying a 30% or more compensably disabled veteran. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Physical Qualifications').

### How do maximum entry-age requirements affect preference eligibles?
Based on the Merit Systems Protection Board decision in *Isabella v. Department of State*, qualified preference eligibles may apply and be considered for vacancies with maximum entry-age restrictions (e.g., law enforcement, firefighters) regardless of whether they meet that age, *unless* the agency demonstrates that the maximum entry-age is essential to performing the position. If waived, the corresponding mandatory retirement age may also be adjusted. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Age Qualifications').

---

## Preference in Examinations and Appointments

### How is preference applied in competitive examinations using numerical scores (Rule of Three)?
When numerical scores are used (often called the 'Rule of Three' method):
*   Eligible veterans get 5 or 10 points added to their passing score.
*   For most positions (below GS-9 scientific/professional), names of 10-point preference eligibles with a compensable disability of 10% or more (CP and CPS) are placed at the top of the register, ordered by their scores.
*   Other 10-point eligibles, 5-point eligibles, and non-preference eligibles are listed in order of their augmented scores.
*   A preference eligible is listed ahead of a non-preference eligible with the same final rating.
Selection is made from the highest three available eligibles on the certificate. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Preference in Competitive Examinations' and 'The "Rule of Three" and Veteran pass overs').

### How is preference applied when an agency uses Category Rating?
Under category rating, applicants meeting minimum qualifications are placed into two or more pre-defined quality categories (e.g., "Best Qualified," "Well Qualified") instead of being ranked by numerical score.
*   Preference eligibles are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles *within each quality category*.
*   Veterans' preference is absolute within each category. An agency cannot select a non-preference eligible from a category if there are preference eligibles in the same or a higher category, unless pass-over procedures are followed.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Filling a Position Through the Competitive Examining Process, Category Rating').

### Can an agency pass over a preference eligible to select a non-preference eligible?
Generally, an agency may not pass over a preference eligible on a certificate to select a lower-ranking non-preference eligible (or one with the same or lower score under numerical ranking) unless the agency's objection to the preference eligible is sustained by the examining office (or OPM in certain cases). Reasons must be valid (e.g., medical, suitability). (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: The "Rule of Three" and Veteran pass overs' and 'Disqualifications of Preference Eligibles').

### What are the special procedures for passing over a 30% or more disabled veteran?
If an agency proposes to pass over a disabled veteran with a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more (CP/CPS) on a certificate to select a non-preference eligible, or to disqualify such a veteran based on physical requirements:
1.  The agency must notify both OPM and the disabled veteran of the reasons.
2.  The veteran has 15 days to respond to OPM.
3.  OPM makes a determination on the veteran's physical ability or the sufficiency of other reasons.
4.  The agency must comply with OPM's decision. OPM cannot delegate this function.
These procedures also apply to pass-overs of such veterans in the excepted service under 5 CFR Part 302, due to the *Gingery v. Department of Defense* decision. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Disqualification of 30 Percent or more Disabled Veterans' and 'Chapter 2: Excepted Service Procedures for Pass Over...').

### Does preference apply in the Excepted Service?
Yes. The Veterans' Preference Act requires appointing authorities in the executive branch to select from qualified applicants for excepted service vacancies in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service (5 U.S.C. 3308-3318), unless the positions are exempt (e.g., appointments requiring Senate confirmation). OPM regulations for preference in excepted appointments are in 5 CFR Part 302. For positions exempt from Part 302 (e.g., attorneys), agencies need only follow the principle of veterans' preference as far as administratively feasible (consider veteran status as a positive factor). (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Excepted Service Employment').

### How does nepotism law interact with veterans' preference?
A public official generally cannot appoint or advocate for a relative. However, this restriction does *not* prohibit appointing a preference eligible relative whose name is within reach on a certificate if an alternative selection cannot be made without passing over that preference eligible and selecting a non-preference eligible. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 2: Preference Eligibles and the Nepotism Provision').

## Special Appointing Authorities for Veterans

### What are special appointing authorities for veterans?
These are specific hiring paths that allow agencies to appoint eligible veterans to federal jobs, sometimes non-competitively. Key authorities include:
*   **Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA)**
*   **30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans**
*   **Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program**
*   **Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA)**
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: Special Appointing Authorities for Veterans').

### What is the Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) authority?
VRA is a special authority allowing agencies to appoint eligible veterans without competition to positions up to GS-11 or equivalent (promotion potential is not a factor). These are excepted appointments that can be converted to career/career-conditional after two years of satisfactory service. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) Authority').

### Who is eligible for a VRA?
To be eligible for a VRA, a veteran must be:
*   A disabled veteran; OR
*   A veteran who served on active duty during a war, or in a campaign/expedition for which a campaign badge was authorized; OR
*   A veteran who, while on active duty, participated in a U.S. military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded; OR
*   A "recently separated veteran" (within 3 years of discharge/release from active duty).
The veteran must have been separated under honorable conditions. Not all 5-point preference eligibles are VRA eligible. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: VRA Authority, Eligibility Criteria').

### How does Veterans' Preference apply when considering multiple VRA candidates?
If an agency has two or more VRA candidates for the same job and one or more is a preference eligible (e.g., one VRA candidate is disabled, another is VRA eligible due to an Armed Forces Service Medal but not otherwise preference eligible), the agency *must* apply the Veterans' Preference procedures from 5 CFR Part 302 in making the VRA appointment. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: VRA Authority, Eligibility Criteria' (Note) and 'Making Appointments').

### What happens after 2 years under a VRA appointment?
After two years of satisfactory service, the agency *must* convert the VRA appointee to a career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: VRA Authority').

### What is the appointing authority for 30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans?
Agencies can give a non-competitive temporary appointment (more than 60 days) or a term appointment to any veteran:
*   Retired from active military service with a disability rating of 30% or more; OR
*   Rated by the VA as having a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more.
There's no grade level limit, but the appointee must meet qualification requirements. This appointment can be converted to career/career-conditional at any time. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: 30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans').

### What is the appointing authority for Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program?
Disabled veterans eligible for VA vocational rehabilitation (38 U.S.C. Chapter 31) can train or gain work experience at an agency. Upon successful completion, the agency and VA issue a Certificate of Training. This certificate allows *any* agency to appoint the veteran non-competitively to a status quo appointment, which can be converted to career/career-conditional. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program').

### What is the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA)?
VEOA allows preference eligibles or eligible veterans (generally those with 3 or more years of continuous active service performed under honorable conditions) to apply for positions announced under agency merit promotion procedures when the agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce. If selected, they receive a career or career-conditional appointment. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA)').

### Who is eligible for VEOA appointments?
An applicant must be:
*   A preference eligible; OR
*   A veteran separated from the armed forces after 3 or more years of continuous active service performed under honorable conditions. (Veterans released shortly before completing a 3-year tour are generally considered eligible).
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: VEOA, Eligibility Requirements').

### Does Veterans' Preference (points) apply to VEOA appointments?
No. Veterans' preference (i.e., adding 5 or 10 points) does not apply to VEOA appointments because these are considered merit promotion actions, not competitive examinations. VEOA provides access to compete. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: VEOA, Questions and Answers').

### Can a current federal employee use VEOA?
Yes. A current career/career-conditional federal employee who is also a preference eligible or VEOA-eligible veteran can apply under VEOA to a merit promotion announcement that is open to candidates outside the agency's workforce, especially if they are outside the stated area of consideration for the announcement. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 4: VEOA, Questions and Answers').

## Veterans' Preference in Reductions in Force (RIF)

### How does preference apply in Reductions in Force (RIF)?
Veterans have advantages over non-veterans in a RIF. Employees are ranked on retention registers based on tenure, veterans' preference, length of service, and performance. Preference eligibles are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles within each tenure group, making them generally the last to be affected. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 3: Veterans' Preference in Reduction in Force').

### How are military retirees treated for RIF preference?
Military retirees must meet additional conditions for RIF preference:
*   **Retirees below Major (or equivalent):** Get preference if retirement was for disability from armed conflict/instrumentality of war, OR retired pay is not based on 20+ years of full-time active service, OR continuously employed in a covered position since Nov 30, 1964.
*   **Retirees at/above Major (or equivalent):** Get preference only if they are disabled veterans (XP, CP, CPS) AND meet one of the criteria for those retired below Major.
A Reservist eligible for retired pay at age 60 who retired at/above Major is preference eligible for RIF only if also a disabled veteran. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 3: Eligibility for Veterans' Preference in RIF').

### What are retention subgroups in a RIF?
Within each tenure group (I, II, or III), employees are placed in subgroups based on veteran status:
*   **Subgroup AD:** Preference eligibles with a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more.
*   **Subgroup A:** All other preference eligibles (including derived preference).
*   **Subgroup B:** Non-preference eligibles.
Employees in AD are retained longest, followed by A, then B, within the same tenure group. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 3: RIF Retention Standing').

### What are "bump" and "retreat" rights in a RIF for preference eligibles?
When an employee in Tenure Group I or II with a minimally successful rating is released from a competitive level, they may displace another employee with lower retention standing:
*   **Bumping:** To a position no more than 3 grades lower in the same competitive area held by an employee in a lower group/subgroup.
*   **Retreating:** To an essentially identical position previously held, no more than 3 grades lower, held by an employee with lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup. A 30%+ disabled veteran can retreat to a position up to 5 grades lower.
An employee with an unacceptable rating has no bump/retreat rights. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 3: Assignment Rights (Bump and Retreat)').

### Are there special RIF protections for employees returning from uniformed service?
Yes. Employees are not subject to RIF while serving in the uniformed services. After returning from active duty:
*   If served > 180 days: Cannot be separated by RIF for 1 year after return.
*   If served > 30 but < 181 days: Cannot be separated by RIF for 6 months after return.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 3: RIF Retention Standing' and 'Chapter 7: Employee Protections').

## Service Credit for Veterans

### How is military service credited for leave accrual and retirement for non-retired veterans?
For non-retired members, full credit for honorable uniformed service (active duty and active duty for training) is given for leave accrual. For retirement, credit is given if a deposit (e.g., 7% of basic military pay for CSRS, 3% for FERS, for post-1956 service) is made to the retirement fund. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 6: Service Credit for Leave Rate Accrual and Retirement, Not Retired from Uniformed Service').

### How is military service credited for leave accrual and retirement for military retirees?
Credit is substantially limited:
*   **For leave accrual:** Retirees receive credit only for actual service during a declared war (WWII), or in a campaign/expedition with an authorized badge, OR all active duty if retirement was for disability from armed conflict/instrumentality of war during a period of war.
*   **For retirement:** An employee must waive military retired pay to get credit, unless the retired pay is for combat-related disability or under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1223 (reservist retirement).
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 6: Service Credit for Leave Rate Accrual and Retirement, Retired from Uniformed Service').

### How is military service credited for RIF purposes?
*   **Non-retired members:** Total time in active service (including active duty and active duty for training) is credited.
*   **Retired members:** Credit is limited. A retiree who is preference eligible for RIF gets credit for all active duty. Other retirees get credit only for active duty during a declared war or in a campaign/expedition with an authorized badge.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 6: Creditable Service for RIF').

### Is military service creditable for severance pay?
Only military service performed by an employee who returns to civilian service by exercising a restoration right under law is creditable for severance pay. Military service *prior* to an individual's initial Federal civilian service is generally not creditable for severance pay. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 6: Creditable Service for Severance Pay').

---

## Other Rights and Protections

### Are there jobs restricted only to preference eligibles?
Yes. Appointments for positions of guards, elevator operators, messengers, and custodians are restricted to preference eligibles when they are available, through competitive examination and "outside the register" procedures. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 5: Miscellaneous Provisions Pertaining to Veterans, Jobs Restricted to Preference Eligibles').

### What are reinstatement rights for preference eligibles?
Preference eligibles (including those with derived preference) who served under a career or career-conditional appointment for any period have lifetime reinstatement eligibility to any competitive service position for which qualified, regardless of when their Armed Forces service occurred. Competition under an agency's merit promotion plan is required if the position is at a higher grade or has more promotion potential than previously held. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 5: Miscellaneous Provisions Pertaining to Veterans, Reinstatement').

### Is there a restriction on DoD employment for recent military retirees?
Yes. A retired member of the Armed Forces generally may not be appointed to a civilian position in the Department of Defense (DoD) within 180 days after retirement, unless authorized by the Secretary concerned, the position has special pay, or a national emergency exists. OPM has delegated this approval authority to DoD. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 5: 180-Day Restriction on Department Of Defense (DOD) Employment of Military Retirees').

### What are an agency's affirmative action responsibilities for veterans under Title 38?
38 U.S.C. Â§ 4214 requires agencies to have a separate affirmative action program for disabled veterans. This includes:
*   Providing placement consideration under special noncompetitive hiring authorities for VRA eligibles and 30% or more disabled veterans.
*   Ensuring all veterans are considered for employment and advancement under merit system rules.
*   Establishing an affirmative action plan for hiring, placement, and advancement of disabled veterans.
Title 38 does not provide preference; it calls for these affirmative actions. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 5: Affirmative Action for Certain Veterans Under Title 38').

### What are restoration rights after returning from uniformed service?
Federal employees (permanent or temporary) who perform duty with a uniformed service are generally entitled to be restored to the position they would have attained if not for the service, or a similar one, provided they:
*   Gave advance notice (unless prevented by military necessity).
*   Were released under honorable conditions.
*   Served no more than a cumulative total of 5 years (with exceptions).
*   Apply for restoration within specified time limits.
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 7: Restoration after Uniformed Service, Basic Entitlement').

### What are the time limits for applying for restoration after uniformed service?
*   **Service less than 31 days:** Report back next scheduled workday + 8 hours travel.
*   **Service more than 30 but less than 181 days:** Apply within 14 days after completion.
*   **Service more than 180 days:** Apply within 90 days after completion.
Failure to meet limits can lead to disciplinary action. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 7: Time Limits').

### What paid military leave are federal employees entitled to?
Permanent federal employees earn 15 days (120 hours) of paid military leave per fiscal year for active duty, active duty training, or inactive duty training. Up to 15 days (120 hours) can be carried over to the next fiscal year (allowing up to 30 days, or 45 if service spans two fiscal years). Part-time employees earn military leave pro-rata. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 7: Paid Military Leave').

---

## Appeals and Complaints

### What appeal rights do preference eligibles have regarding adverse actions?
Preference eligibles have protections against adverse actions (demotion, suspension >14 days, furlough <=30 days, removal). These include advance notice, time to respond, representation, a final written decision, and appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This applies to those under career/career-conditional (not on probation), competitive service appointments (>1 year continuous service, not temp <1 year), and certain excepted service appointments (>1 year current continuous service). (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 8: Special Redress And Appeals, Adverse Actions').

### Where can I appeal a RIF action?
An employee furloughed, separated, or demoted by RIF action can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), unless a negotiated grievance procedure must be used. Appeals usually must be filed within 30 days after the RIF effective date. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 3: Appeal of RIF Actions' and 'Chapter 8: Reduction in Force').

### What if I believe my restoration rights after uniformed service have been violated?
Applicants or employees who believe an agency has not complied with USERRA or OPM regulations on restoration rights after uniformed service can:
*   File a complaint with the Department of Labor's Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) local office.
*   Appeal directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).
(See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 8: Restoration after Uniformed Service').

### Where can I file a complaint if I believe my veterans' preference rights were violated during hiring?
The Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) allows preference eligibles to complain to the Department of Labor's VETS if they believe an agency violated their rights under any statute/regulation relating to veterans' preference.
Additionally, under an MOU between OPM and DOL, eligible veterans who believe an agency didn't properly accord preference, list jobs with state employment services, or provide special placement consideration can file a complaint with the local DOL VETS representative.
A willful violation of veterans' preference law is a Prohibited Personnel Practice. Disabled veterans can also file discrimination complaints with the agency's EEO office. (See OPM Vet Guide, 'Chapter 8: Other Actions').
