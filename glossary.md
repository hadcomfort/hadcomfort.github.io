Definition: Periods of federal civilian and military service that count towards eligibility for or computation of various federal benefits.
*   **RIF:** Includes total active service in the Armed Forces (including active duty for training for non-retired members). For retired members, credit is limited (e.g., active duty during a war or campaign unless they are preference eligible for RIF).

(Source: hrdocs, OPM.gov intro)

### Dual Compensation Act
Definition: Refers to laws that have historically placed restrictions on the employment and compensation of retired military members in federal civilian positions.

### Merit Promotion Procedures / Merit Promotion List
Definition: Processes (often detailed in an agency's merit promotion plan) that agencies use to fill positions by promoting, reassigning, or transferring current federal employees or those with competitive status, based on job-related criteria and fair and open competition.
