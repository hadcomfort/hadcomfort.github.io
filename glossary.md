### Active Duty
Definition: As defined in 5 U.S.C. 2101(2), "Armed Forces" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. For non-disabled users, active duty for training by National Guard or Reserve soldiers does not qualify as "active duty" for preference. For disabled veterans, active duty includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard, per the Merit Systems Protection Board decision in Hesse v. Department of the Army, 104 M.S.P.R.647(2007). The VOW Act also requires Federal agencies to treat certain active duty service members as preference eligibles for purposes of an appointment in the competitive or excepted service, even though the service members have not been discharged or released from active duty.

### Honorable Conditions
Definition: To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty in the Armed Forces under honorable conditions (i.e., with an honorable or general discharge).

### Compensable Service-Connected Disability
Definition: A disability of a veteran rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as being service-connected and for which compensation is payable. For preference purposes, this generally refers to disabilities rated at 10% or more.
Specific preference categories related to this include:
- **10-Point Compensable Disability Preference (CP):** For veterans with a compensable service-connected disability rating of at least 10 percent but less than 30 percent.
- **10-Point 30 Percent Compensable Disability Preference (CPS):** For veterans with a compensable service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more.

### VRA (Veterans Recruitment Appointment)
Definition: A special authority by which agencies can, if they wish, appoint eligible veterans without competition to positions at any grade level through General Schedule (GS) 11 or equivalent. VRA appointees are hired under excepted appointments to positions that are otherwise in the competitive service. After two years of satisfactory service, the agency must convert the veteran to career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate.
Eligibility Criteria:
- Disabled veterans; or
- Veterans who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or
- Veterans who, while serving on active duty in the Armed Forces, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded; or
- Recently separated veterans.
(Must have been separated under honorable conditions).

### VEOA (Veterans Employment Opportunities Act)
Definition: The Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) provides that agencies must allow preference eligibles or eligible veterans to apply for positions announced under merit promotion procedures when the agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce. A VEOA eligible who competes under merit promotion procedures and is selected will be given a career or career conditional appointment. Veterans' preference is not a factor in these appointments.
Eligibility Requirements:
- Be a preference eligible OR veteran separated from the armed forces after 3 or more years of continuous active service performed under honorable conditions.

### RIF (Reduction in Force)
Definition: A process by which agencies reduce their workforce when positions are abolished or significantly changed. Veterans have advantages over nonveterans in a RIF. Employees are ranked on retention registers based on tenure, Veterans' preference, length of service, and performance.

### Preference Eligible
Definition: An individual who meets the criteria defined in 5 U.S.C. 2108. This includes veterans who are disabled or who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns, and in some cases, spouses, widows/widowers, or mothers of veterans. To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions.

### Disabled Veteran
Definition: For preference purposes, a veteran who has a present service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pension from the military or the Department of Veterans Affairs. This also includes veterans who received a Purple Heart. For RIF purposes, specific conditions apply to military retirees at or above the rank of major (or equivalent) who must be disabled veterans as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2108(2) to receive preference.

### Sole Survivorship Discharge (SSP - 0-point Preference)
Definition: A new veterans’ preference eligibility category established by the Hubbard Act (Public Law 110-317) for veterans released or discharged from a period of active duty from the armed forces, after August 29, 2008, by reason of a “sole survivorship discharge.” Under this preference, the individual does not receive points but is entitled to be listed ahead of non-preference eligibles with the same score or in the same quality category, and has pass over rights and credit for experience. This applies to the only surviving child in a family where the father, mother, or one or more siblings served and suffered certain qualifying conditions (death, capture, disability) not due to misconduct.

### Derived Preference (XP - 10-Point)
Definition: Preference granted to spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans when the veteran is unable to use the preference. Specific conditions apply for each category (Spouse, Widow/Widower, Mother of a deceased veteran, Mother of a disabled veteran) concerning the veteran's service, disability, or death, and the claimant's marital status and living situation. Neither a mother nor a spouse may receive preference if the veteran is living and qualified for Federal employment.

### SF-15 (Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference)
Definition: A standard form that must be completed by applicants claiming 10-point veteran preference. It requires submission of requested documentation to verify eligibility for these types of preference.

### War
Definition: For purposes of veterans' preference under 5 U.S.C. 2108, "war" means only those armed conflicts declared by Congress as war and includes World War II (December 7, 1941, to April 28, 1952). This definition is different from "period of war" used by the VA for Title 38 benefits.

### Armed Forces
Definition: As defined in 5 U.S.C. 2101(2), "Armed Forces" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.

### Certification (VOW Act)
Definition: Under the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) to Hire Heroes Act, a "certification" is any written document from the armed forces that certifies a service member is expected to be discharged or released from active duty service under honorable conditions within 120 days after the certification is submitted. This allows active duty service members to be treated as preference eligibles for job application purposes before they have a DD Form 214.

### Category Rating
Definition: An alternative ranking and selection procedure where applicants meeting minimum qualifications are placed into predefined quality categories instead of being ranked numerically. Preference eligibles are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles within each quality category. Veterans' preference is absolute within each quality category.
