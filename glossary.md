### Active Duty
Definition: As defined in 5 U.S.C. § 2101(2), "Armed Forces" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. For non-disabled users, active duty for training by National Guard or Reserve soldiers does not qualify as "active duty" for preference. For disabled veterans, active duty includes training service in the Reserves or National Guard, per the Merit Systems Protection Board decision in Hesse v. Department of the Army, 104 M.S.P.R.647(2007). The VOW Act also requires Federal agencies to treat certain active duty service members as preference eligibles for purposes of an appointment in the competitive or excepted service, even though the service members have not been discharged or released from active duty.

### Armed Forces Service Medal
Definition: A military award presented to members of the U.S. Armed Forces who participate in a U.S. military operation deemed to be a significant activity for which no other campaign or service medal is authorized. Eligibility for certain veterans' appointing authorities, like VRA, can be based on receipt of this medal.

### Campaign Badge

### Career or Career-Conditional Appointment
Definition: Standard types of appointments in the federal competitive service. A career-conditional appointment is the initial type of permanent appointment, and employees must typically complete three years of substantially continuous creditable service to attain a career appointment. These appointments provide job security and benefits. Some special appointing authorities, like VRA, allow for conversion to these appointments after a specified period.

### Category Rating
Definition: An alternative ranking and selection procedure where applicants meeting minimum qualifications are placed into predefined quality categories instead of being ranked numerically. Preference eligibles are listed ahead of non-preference eligibles within each quality category. Veterans' preference is absolute within each quality category.

### Certification (VOW Act)
Definition: Under the VOW (Veterans Opportunity to Work) to Hire Heroes Act, a "certification" is any written document from the armed forces that certifies a service member is expected to be discharged or released from active duty service under honorable conditions within 120 days after the certification is submitted. This allows active duty service members to be treated as preference eligibles for job application purposes before they have a DD Form 214.

### Derived Preference (XP - 10-Point)
Definition: Preference granted to spouses, widows, widowers, or mothers of veterans when the veteran is unable to use the preference. Specific conditions apply for each category (Spouse, Widow/Widower, Mother of a deceased veteran, Mother of a disabled veteran) concerning the veteran's service, disability, or death, and the claimant's marital status and living situation. Neither a mother nor a spouse may receive preference if the veteran is living and qualified for Federal employment. (See 5 U.S.C. § 2108)

The Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA) allows certain veterans to compete for these positions even if they are not current agency employees.

Definition: An individual who meets the criteria defined in 5 U.S.C. § 2108. This includes veterans who are disabled or who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns, and in some cases, spouses, widows/widowers, or mothers of veterans. To receive preference, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions.

This applies to the only surviving child in a family where the father, mother, or one or more siblings served and suffered certain qualifying conditions (death, capture, disability) not due to misconduct. (See 5 U.S.C. § 2108a)

### Status Quo Appointment

### Time-in-Grade Requirements

### VEOA (Veterans Employment Opportunities Act)
Definition: The Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), as amended (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 3304), provides that agencies must allow preference eligibles or eligible veterans to apply for positions announced under merit promotion procedures when the agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce. A VEOA eligible who competes under merit promotion procedures and is selected will be given a career or career conditional appointment. Veterans' preference is not a factor in these appointments.
Eligibility Requirements:
- Be a preference eligible OR veteran separated from the armed forces after 3 or more years of continuous active service performed under honorable conditions.

### VRA (Veterans Recruitment Appointment)
Definition: A special authority (see 5 CFR Part 307) by which agencies can, if they wish, appoint eligible veterans without competition to positions at any grade level through General Schedule (GS) 11 or equivalent. VRA appointees are hired under excepted appointments to positions that are otherwise in the competitive service. After two years of satisfactory service, the agency must convert the veteran to career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate.
Eligibility Criteria:

- Veterans who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or
- Veterans who, while serving on active duty in the Armed Forces, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded; or
