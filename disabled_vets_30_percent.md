# Appointment of 30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans

This page details a special appointing authority that allows federal agencies to non-competitively appoint veterans with a service-connected disability rating of 30% or more to federal positions. This authority facilitates the hiring of these highly deserving veterans by providing a more direct path to federal employment, bypassing traditional competitive examining procedures.

## Eligibility Criteria

An agency may give a noncompetitive temporary appointment of more than 60 days or a term appointment to any veteran who meets one of the following criteria:

*   Retired from active military service with a disability rating of 30 percent or more; **OR**
*   Rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) since 1991 or later (to include disability determinations from a branch of the Armed Forces at any time) as having a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more.

## Nature of Appointment

The appointment under this authority is a **noncompetitive temporary appointment of more than 60 days or a term appointment**.

## Grade Level Limitations

There is **no grade level limitation** for this appointing authority.

## Qualification Requirements

The appointee **must meet all qualification requirements** for the position, including any written test requirement.

## Conversion to Career or Career-Conditional Appointment

The agency may convert the employee to a **career or career-conditional appointment at any time** during the employee's temporary or term appointment, without a break in service. This conversion is not guaranteed but is a possibility if the employee performs satisfactorily and the agency has an ongoing need.

This authority provides a significant opportunity for veterans with substantial service-connected disabilities to obtain federal employment, recognizing their service and sacrifice.
