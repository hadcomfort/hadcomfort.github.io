# Idaho Veterans' Preference

The State of Idaho honors veterans by providing them with preference for initial employment with the state, as well as for retention during layoffs. This preference is intended to provide veterans a more favorable competitive position in recognition of their service.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Idaho state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, a veteran must have been discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions. The preference also extends to: [1]
*   The unmarried widow or widower of a preference-eligible veteran.
*   The spouse of a service-connected disabled veteran who cannot qualify for public employment due to their disability.

## Type of Preference

*   **5-Point Preference:** An additional five points are added to the final competitive examination score for any preference-eligible veteran. [1]
*   **10-Point Preference:** Ten points are added for veterans with a service-connected disability of 10% or more or who are Purple Heart recipients. [1]
*   **Guaranteed Interview:** A veteran with a service-connected disability of 30% or more who ranks among the top twenty-five qualified applicants must be offered an interview. [1]
*   **Non-Examined Positions:** For positions that do not require a competitive exam, eligible veterans must be given preference over other applicants who are not more qualified.

## How to Apply

*   Applicants must claim preference by completing and submitting the State of Idaho Veterans' Preference Form (VP-1).
*   Proof of service, such as a DD Form 214, is required.
*   Veterans with a disability must provide a letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs confirming their disability rating.
