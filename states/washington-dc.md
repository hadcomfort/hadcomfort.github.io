# Washington D.C. Veterans' Preference

The District of Columbia grants a hiring preference to eligible veterans for positions in the Career, Educational, and Management Supervisory Services. The preference is awarded by adding points to an applicant's score on any register established for hiring.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, an applicant must be a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces for more than 180 consecutive days and was separated under honorable conditions. Preference may also be extended under certain conditions to:
*   Veterans with a service-connected disability.
*   The spouse or domestic partner of a service-connected disabled veteran.
*   The surviving spouse or domestic partner of a deceased veteran.

## Type of Preference

*   **5-Point Preference:** Awarded to eligible veterans who meet the service requirements.
*   **10-Point Preference:** An additional 5 points (for a total of 10) are awarded to eligible veterans who have a service-connected disability.
*   **Limitations:** The preference is generally available for 5 years from the date of separation. Preference is not granted to military retirees at the rank of Major, Lieutenant Commander, or higher, unless their retirement is based on a service-connected disability.
