# Wisconsin Veterans' Preference

Wisconsin provides a hiring preference to eligible veterans and their spouses when applying for initial state employment. For positions that use a competitive examination, preference is given by adding points to a passing score.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Wisconsin state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

*   **Veterans:** Must have served in the U.S. armed forces and not have been punitively discharged (e.g., dishonorable).
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Must have a service-connected disability rating from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
*   **Spouses:** Certain spouses of veterans may also be eligible.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based (for exams):**
    *   **10 points** for eligible veterans.
    *   **15 points** for veterans with a VA disability rating of less than 30%.
    *   **20 points** for veterans with a VA disability rating of 30% or more.
*   **Non-Competitive Appointment:** Veterans with a service-connected disability rating of 30% or more who are not currently permanent state employees may be eligible for a non-competitive appointment, allowing them to be considered for jobs without competing or taking a civil service assessment.
*   **Categorical:** For positions that do not use a competitive examination, the names of eligible veterans are added to the list of eligible applicants.

## How to Apply

Applicants should claim veteran status on their Wisc.Jobs application. To use the non-competitive appointment process, eligible veterans can apply under a specific job ID (3375) on the Wisc.Jobs website after creating an account. You will need to provide a DD214 and a VA Benefit Summary Letter dated within the last 12 months.
