# Pennsylvania Veterans' Preference

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provides a hiring preference to eligible veterans, their surviving spouses, and spouses of disabled veterans for both civil service and non-civil service positions.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Pennsylvania state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference, an individual must be a "veteran" as defined by the state's Military and Veterans Code. This generally includes:
*   An individual who completed their initial military service obligation and was released under conditions other than "dishonorable." [2]
*   A service member who served on active duty during a war or armed conflict and was honorably discharged. [4]
*   A current member of a reserve component or the National Guard.
*   The preference also extends to the unmarried surviving spouse of a deceased veteran and the spouse of a veteran with a permanent and total disability. [2]

## Type of Preference

*   **Civil Service Positions:**
    *   **10-Point Preference:** Eligible veterans receive an additional 10 points on their final passing score on a civil service examination. [2]
    *   **Mandatory Appointment:** A veteran who is among the top three candidates (Rule of Three) on an eligibility list must be given preference in appointment over non-veterans. [2]
*   **Non-Civil Service Positions:** When no examination is required, an appointing authority must give preference to a veteran who possesses the requisite qualifications for the position.
*   **Reduction in Force:** Veterans receive preference in retention during a reduction in force. [5]

## How to Apply

1.  Claim veterans' preference when applying for a Commonwealth job.
2.  Submit a completed **Veterans' Preference Claim Form (STD-32)**.
3.  Provide proof of eligibility, such as a **DD Form 214** or other official service documentation.
4.  Spouses must provide additional documentation, such as a marriage certificate and proof of the veteran's disability or death in service.
5.  Submit all required documents to the Governor's Office of Administration.
