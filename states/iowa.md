# Iowa Veterans' Preference

Iowa law requires that in every public department and upon all public works in the state, counties, cities, and school corporations, veterans are entitled to preference in appointment and employment over other applicants of no greater qualifications.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Iowa state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for preference, an individual must be an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces who served on active duty. [3] The benefit also extends to former members of the Reserve Forces or Iowa National Guard with at least 20 years of service after January 28, 1973, or those activated for federal duty for at least 90 days. [2]

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based (for examined positions):** For jobs filled by competitive examination or appointment, points are added to a veteran's passing score. [3]
    *   **5 Points:** Awarded to all eligible veterans.
    *   **10 Points:** An additional 5 points (for a total of 10) are added if the veteran has a service-connected disability, is receiving VA disability compensation, or was awarded the Purple Heart.
*   **Preference in Appointment:** For non-examined positions, preference is given to a veteran over a non-veteran applicant with equal qualifications. [4]
*   **Retention Preference:** Veterans also have preference in retention during layoffs.

## How to Apply

*   Veterans must request preference at the time of application.
*   Proof of eligibility, such as a DD Form 214 (Member 4 or Service 2 copy), is required to document honorable discharge and dates of service.
*   To claim disability points, documentation of a service-connected disability or Purple Heart award is necessary.
