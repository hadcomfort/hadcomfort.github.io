# New York Veterans' Preference

New York State provides certain rights for veterans for civil service exams, including the addition of veterans' credits to passing exam scores. [4]

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official New York state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' credits, a veteran must be a New York resident who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces (other than for training purposes) and received an honorable discharge or will be honorably discharged at the time of appointment. [2]

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** Disabled veterans receive 10 points of additional credit on open-competitive examinations and five points in promotion examinations. Non-disabled veterans are granted five points in open-competitive examinations and two and one-half points in promotion examinations. [2]
*   **Veterans with Disabilities Employment Program (55-c):** This program authorizes 500 entry-level positions to be filled with qualified wartime veterans with disabilities. Eligible veterans who meet the minimum qualifications for the position are not required to take an initial written examination. [2]

## How to Apply

To apply for extra credits on a state exam, veterans must complete the application for veterans' credits. For the Veterans with Disabilities program, an application and certification are required. [4]
