# Florida Veterans' Preference

In recognition of the sacrifices made by veterans, Florida law provides preference in employment and retention for public positions to eligible veterans and their spouses. The preference is applied by adding points to examination scores or, in cases where an exam is not used, granting preference to equally qualified candidates.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Florida state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

Individuals eligible for veterans' preference in Florida include: [1]
*   Veterans with a service-connected disability.
*   The spouse of a veteran who cannot work due to a total and permanent service-connected disability, or the spouse of a veteran listed as missing in action or captured.
*   A wartime veteran who served on active duty during a specified wartime period.
*   The unremarried widow or widower of a veteran who died of a service-connected disability.
*   The parent or legal guardian of a service member who died in a combat-related incident.
*   A veteran who served honorably on active duty in any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.
*   Current members of any reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces or the Florida National Guard.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** When a numerically based examination is used for hiring, preference points are added to the passing scores of eligible applicants. [2]
*   **Non-Examined Positions:** In situations where a numerical exam is not used, preference must be given to an eligible veteran over a non-veteran applicant with equal qualifications. [1]
*   **Retention:** During layoffs or reductions in force, eligible veterans are given preference in retention over non-veterans. [1]
*   **Education Waiver:** State agencies and political subdivisions may waive postsecondary education requirements for a position if a veteran is otherwise qualified. [2]

## How to Apply

*   Applicants must claim preference at the time of application.
*   A Veterans' Preference Claim Form, along with supporting documentation such as a DD Form 214, must be submitted.
*   For disabled veterans, documentation from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) certifying a service-connected disability is required.
