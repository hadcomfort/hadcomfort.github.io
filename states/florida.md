# Florida Veterans' Benefits and Preference

Florida is home to over 1.4 million veterans, the second-largest veteran population in the nation. In recognition of their service and sacrifices, the state offers a robust system of benefits, headlined by a strong veterans' preference in public employment. This guide provides a summary of these key benefits.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary based on available information. For the most accurate and up-to-date details, please consult the official Florida state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Florida's Commitment to Veterans

The state's commitment is spearheaded by the **Florida Department of Veterans' Affairs (FDVA)**, which serves as the primary resource for Florida's veterans. The FDVA's mission is to advocate for veterans and connect them to earned services, benefits, and support.

Key state-supported initiatives include:
*   **Hope Florida:** An initiative to guide veterans and their families toward economic self-sufficiency by connecting them with community resources.
*   **State Women Veterans' Coordinator:** A dedicated coordinator to assist the state's 164,000 women veterans with access to benefits and services.
*   **Veterans Florida:** A non-profit created by the state to connect veterans with employment, training, and educational opportunities.
*   **Florida Veterans Foundation:** A non-profit that acts as a safety net, assisting veterans in need with housing, transportation, and other emergency support.

## Veterans' Preference in Public Employment

Florida law (Florida Statutes §§ 295.07) mandates that the state and its political subdivisions (counties, cities, school districts) give preference in employment, promotions, and retention to eligible veterans and certain family members.

### How Preference is Applied

Preference is guaranteed to eligible, qualified applicants at **every step of the hiring process**, not just as a one-time addition of points.
*   **Comprehensive Application:** Preference must be considered throughout the selection process for any position where a veteran meets the minimum qualifications.
*   **Points-Based:** When a numerically based examination is used, preference points are added to the passing scores of eligible applicants.
*   **Non-Examined Positions:** In situations where a numerical exam is not used, preference must be given to an eligible veteran over a non-veteran applicant with equal qualifications.
*   **Retention and Promotions:** During layoffs, eligible veterans are given preference in retention. Preference is also given for promotions after an employee has been deployed on active duty.
*   **Education Waiver:** State and local government employers may waive postsecondary education requirements for a position if a veteran is otherwise qualified.
*   **Preference in Perpetuity:** A veteran does not lose eligibility for preference after being hired for their first public sector job. It can be used for any subsequent public employment applications in Florida.

### Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, a veteran must have been honorably discharged. Individuals who qualify include:
*   A veteran with a service-connected disability who is eligible for or receiving compensation, disability retirement, or pension from the VA.
*   The spouse of a veteran who cannot work due to a total and permanent service-connected disability.
*   The spouse of a veteran listed as missing in action, captured in the line of duty, or forcibly detained.
*   A wartime veteran who served on active duty for at least one day during a specified wartime period.
*   The unremarried widow or widower of a veteran who died of a service-connected disability.
*   The parent, legal guardian, or unremarried widow/widower of a service member who died in a combat-related incident.
*   A veteran who served honorably on active duty in any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.
*   A current member of any reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces or the Florida National Guard.

### How to Claim Preference

*   **Claim on Application:** Applicants must claim preference at the time of application, often using the FDVA Form VP-1 or an equivalent integrated into the application.
*   **Submit Documentation:** Supporting documentation must be submitted to the hiring agency by the application deadline.
*   **Required Documentation:**
    *   **All Veterans:** DD Form 214 (Member 4 copy) or equivalent discharge papers.
    *   **Disabled Veterans:** Documentation from the VA or DoD certifying a service-connected disability.
    *   **Spouses of Disabled Veterans:** VA/DoD documentation of the veteran's total and permanent disability, a marriage certificate, and a statement of current marriage.
    *   **Current Reserve/Guard Members:** A signed FDVA Form VP-2 or letter from a commanding officer certifying current honorable service.
    *   **Other Categories:** Specific documentation from the VA or DoD certifying the veteran's status (MIA, combat-related death, etc.), along with proof of relationship (e.g., marriage certificate) and statements of status (e.g., unremarried).

### Complaints

An applicant who believes they were not afforded their rightful preference may file a complaint with the FDVA within 60 days of receiving a non-select notice.
