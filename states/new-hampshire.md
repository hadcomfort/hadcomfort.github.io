# New Hampshire Veterans' Preference

The state of New Hampshire grants a preference in hiring to veterans and disabled veterans. [6]

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official New Hampshire state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

A veteran or disabled veteran may use the preference for a position for state employment at any time after discharge or release from service in the armed forces of the United States. A veteran or disabled veteran may claim the preference an unlimited number of times. [3]

## Type of Preference

A public employer will appoint an otherwise qualified veteran or disabled veteran to a vacant position for state employment if the results of a veteran's or disabled veteran's application examination, when combined with the veteran's or disabled veteran's preference, are equal to or higher than the results of an application examination for an applicant who is not a veteran or disabled veteran. [5]

## How to Apply

A public employer that does not appoint a veteran or disabled veteran to a vacant position for state employment must, upon written request of the veteran or disabled veteran, provide an explanation of its decision. [5]
