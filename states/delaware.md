# Delaware Veterans' Benefits and Preference

Delaware demonstrates its commitment to veterans through the **Delaware Commission of Veterans Affairs (DCVA)** and the **Office of Veterans Services (OVS)**. The DCVA acts as an advisory board to the Governor, ensuring the veteran community's voice is heard in state policy, while the OVS executes the day-to-day services and programs.

This page summarizes the hiring preference offered to veterans for state merit system employment, as well as other key state benefits.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Delaware state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Veterans' Hiring Preference for State Employment

Delaware offers a veterans' hiring preference to veterans, disabled veterans, and certain family members for initial appointments to State Merit system jobs. Preference is given by awarding points that are added to passing entrance exam scores. This preference does **not** apply to promotions, transfers, or retention in the event of a reduction in force.
