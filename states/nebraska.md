# Nebraska Veterans' Preference

Nebraska law requires that a preference be given to eligible veterans, service members, and eligible spouses seeking initial or return employment with the State of Nebraska or any state or local government. [1]

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Nebraska state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference, a veteran must have been honorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces. The preference also extends to the spouses of 100% disabled veterans. [4]

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** Veterans with passing scores on all parts of an examination or numerical scoring will have five percent added to their passing score. An additional five percent will be added to the passing score of any disabled veteran. [1]
*   **Categorical Preference:** When no examination or numerical scoring is used, preference will be given to the qualifying veteran if two or more equally qualified candidates are being considered for the position. [3]

## How to Apply

A veteran desiring to use a veterans preference must provide the hiring authority with a copy of their DD Form 214. A spouse of a veteran must provide a copy of the veteran's DD Form 214, a copy of the veteran's disability verification from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs demonstrating a one hundred percent permanent disability rating, and proof of marriage.
