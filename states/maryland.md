# Maryland Veterans' Preference

The State of Maryland provides a hiring preference to eligible veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces when applying for positions in the State Personnel Management System. The preference is designed to honor the service of veterans and assist them in securing public employment.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Maryland state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

An applicant must be a veteran who has been honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances from the U.S. Armed Forces. This includes:
*   Service on active duty.
*   Service in a reserve component or the National Guard.
*   The spouse of an eligible veteran who has a service-connected disability or is missing in action.

## Type of Preference

*   **Ten-Point Credit:** An additional 10 points are added to an eligible veteran's rating on a selection test for state employment.
*   **Consideration Factor:** In hiring processes that do not use a numerical scoring system, a veteran's military service is considered a positive, determining factor if the veteran's qualifications are otherwise equal to those of a non-veteran applicant.
*   **Not a Guarantee:** The preference does not guarantee a job but provides an advantage in the selection process.

## How to Apply

1.  Applicants must claim the preference by completing the **Claim for Veteran's Preference (Form DBM/ACD-35)**, available from the Department of Budget and Management.
2.  The completed form must be submitted with a copy of the veteran's DD Form 214.
3.  For spousal preference, additional documentation such as a marriage certificate and VA disability letter is required.
4.  The documentation should be submitted with the application for a state position.
