## Eligibility Requirements

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** For positions that require a Training & Experience exam, veterans receive 10 points, and surviving spouses of active-duty service members killed in the line of duty also receive 10 points. Nevada National Guard service members and surviving spouses of deceased veterans receive five points. [5]
*   **Guaranteed Interview:** Veteran applicants with a service-connected disability that meet minimum qualification requirements for a state position are guaranteed an opportunity to interview. [2]
