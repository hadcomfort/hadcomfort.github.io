# North Dakota Veterans' Preference

North Dakota law provides a preference to eligible veterans for recruitment and selection processes in public employment. This preference applies to state, county, and municipal government positions.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official North Dakota state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen and a North Dakota resident. Eligible individuals include:
*   Veterans who served on active duty during a period of war or armed conflict and were discharged under other than dishonorable conditions.
*   Veterans who received an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal or other campaign service medal.
*   Disabled veterans with a service-connected disability.
*   The unremarried spouse of a veteran who died in service or from a service-connected cause.
*   The spouse of a 100% disabled veteran who is unable to use the preference.

## Type of Preference

*   **Absolute Preference:** An eligible veteran who meets the qualifications for the position is entitled to the position over all other applicants, unless there is a justifiable, written reason for not making the selection. [1]
*   **Disabled Veteran Preference:** A disabled veteran is entitled to a preference superior to that of a non-disabled veteran. [5]
*   **Tie-Breaker:** In cases where qualifications are equal, the veteran applicant must be selected.

## How to Apply

1.  Submit a **DD Form 214** with your employment application.
2.  If claiming a disability preference, provide a letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (dated within one year) indicating the disability status. [5]
3.  If claiming as a spouse, provide a marriage certificate and other required documentation (e.g., veteran's DD 214, death certificate, or disability letter). [5]
4.  The hiring agency will verify your eligibility.
