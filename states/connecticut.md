# Connecticut Veterans Benefits and Programs

Connecticut has a rich history of providing steadfast support to its veterans and their families. The state's Department of Veterans Affairs (CT DVA) is dedicated to ensuring that every veteran and eligible family member receives the benefits and services they have honorably earned. This page provides a summary of the key benefits and resources available.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Connecticut state government and federal VA resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Veterans' Preference in Public Employment

Connecticut law provides a veterans' hiring preference for initial state and municipal employment by adding points to passing scores on competitive hiring examinations.

### Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for preference points, an applicant must be an honorably discharged veteran who served at least 90 days of active duty "in time of war," unless separated earlier due to a service-connected disability rated by the VA. Connecticut statute defines "service in time of war" as service during the following periods:

*   **Korean Hostilities:** June 27, 1950 – January 31, 1955
*   **Vietnam Era:** February 28, 1961 – July 1, 1975
*   **Peace Keeping Mission in Lebanon:** September 29, 1982 – March 30, 1984
*   **Invasion of Grenada:** October 25, 1983 – December 15, 1983
*   **Operation Earnest Will (Persian Gulf):** July 24, 1987 – August 1, 1990
*   **Invasion of Panama:** December 20, 1989 – January 31, 1990
*   **Operation Desert Storm & Operation Desert Shield:** August 2, 1990 – June 30, 1994

### Type of Preference

*   **10 Points:** Awarded to eligible wartime veterans who are receiving or eligible for at least 10% disability compensation from the VA. This preference also extends to:
    *   The spouse of a qualified disabled veteran who is unable to work due to their disability.
    *   The surviving spouse of a veteran who was eligible for the 10-point preference.
*   **5 Points:** Awarded to eligible wartime veterans who are not receiving VA compensation or pension.

### How to Apply and Key Considerations

*   **Application:** Veterans must submit proof of eligibility with their job application. This documentation must be received by the closing date listed in the position announcement.
*   **Required Documents:**
    *   **DD Form 214:** A certified or photostatic copy showing honorable service.
    *   **Proof of Disability (for 10-point preference):** A letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) certifying a service-connected disability.
*   **Important Note:** The preference applies only to initial employment and is added to a *passing score* on a competitive examination. The practical impact may be limited for positions that do not use a scored exam as a primary hiring tool.

## Financial Benefits and Tax Exemptions

### Property Tax Exemptions

Connecticut offers a multi-layered system of property tax exemptions for eligible veterans, with municipalities having the option to offer additional benefits.
*   **Standard Exemption:** Wartime veterans generally receive a $1,000 reduction in the assessed value of their property ($1,500 for WWII veterans).
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Exemptions increase with the VA disability rating, ranging from $2,000 for a 10% rating up to $10,000 for severely disabled veterans.
*   **Surviving Spouses:** Unmarried surviving spouses may be eligible for exemptions of $1,000 or more, depending on circumstances.
*   **Income-Based Exemptions:** Veterans meeting certain income limits may receive an additional exemption.
*   **Specially Adapted Housing:** Municipalities may offer a total property tax exemption for veterans who received a VA grant for specially adapted housing.

### Connecticut Wartime Service Bonus

This grant is for members of the Connecticut National Guard who served on active duty on or after September 11, 2001, for at least 90 consecutive days. The bonus is $50 for each month served, up to $500 for non-combat service and $1,200 for service in a combat zone.

### Soldiers, Sailors', and Marines' Fund (SSMF)

This fund provides temporary financial assistance to needy wartime veterans and their families residing in Connecticut. Aid can cover essential needs like food, housing payments, utilities, medical care, and burial expenses.

## Education and Training

*   **Tuition Waiver for Public Colleges:** Eligible veterans, active CT National Guard members, and certain dependents receive a tuition waiver at Connecticut public colleges and universities. The waiver covers tuition costs that exceed GI Bill benefits but does not cover fees, books, or room and board.
*   **Education Aid for Children of Veterans:** Financial aid is available for children (ages 16-23) of veterans who were killed in action, died due to service, are rated as totally and permanently disabled by the VA, or were declared MIA.
*   **Commercial Driver's License (CDL) Skills Test Exemption:** The skills test portion of the CDL exam may be waived for veterans with recent experience operating comparable military vehicles.
*   **Apprenticeship Programs:** The CT Department of Labor assists veterans with apprenticeship opportunities and may recommend a waiver of apprentice hour requirements to allow qualified veterans to sit for licensing exams sooner.

## Employment Services

Beyond hiring preference, Connecticut offers robust employment support for veterans.
*   **CT Department of Labor (DOL) Veterans Services:** Veterans receive priority reemployment services from trained staff at American Job Centers. Local Veterans Employment Representatives (LVERs) work with employers to promote the hiring of veterans.
*   **Licensing and Certification Assistance:** State agencies facilitate the translation of military training into civilian credentials for various professions, including motor vehicle operators, skilled trades, security guards, and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).
*   **Partner Programs:** The state collaborates with programs like American Corporate Partners (mentoring) and Work Vessels for Veterans (business startup equipment) to support veteran employment.
