# Alaska Veterans' Benefits

The state of Alaska offers a wide array of benefits for its resident veterans, active-duty service members, and their families. These benefits range from financial assistance and tax exemptions to unique opportunities in housing and recreation. This page provides a comprehensive summary of available programs.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Alaska state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Employment Benefits

Alaska provides several advantages for veterans in public employment, including hiring preferences, retirement credit, and licensing assistance.

### Hiring Preference
Eligible veterans, service members, and former prisoners of war receive a preference for state government jobs. The preference applies through the entire hiring process and for retention during a reduction in force. To be eligible, applicants must meet the job's minimum qualifications and have an honorable discharge.
*   **Points-Based System:** If a numerical rating is used, 5 points are added to the score of a veteran or National Guard member. Disabled veterans, former POWs, and their eligible surviving spouses receive a 10-point preference.
*   **No Numerical Rating:** In hiring processes without a point system, special consideration is given to veterans. An interview is guaranteed for disabled veterans and former POWs.

### Retirement & Leave
*   **Military Service Credit:** Veterans vested in the Alaska Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) may purchase up to five years of service credit for their active-duty time. This credit is used to calculate the monthly benefit amount upon retirement.
*   **Leave for Military Duty:** State employees who are members of the National Guard or Reserves are authorized 16.5 days of paid military leave annually for training.

### Professional Licensing
To ease the transition for service members and their spouses, Alaska offers expedited temporary professional licenses, valid for 180 days, to individuals who hold a valid license in another state. The state also accepts military education and training toward meeting the requirements for full licensure.

## Tax & Financial Benefits

### Income & Property Tax
Alaska has no state income tax. Additionally, veterans with a VA disability rating of 50% or greater are exempt from property taxes on the first $150,000 of the assessed value of their primary residence. This exemption can be transferred to a surviving spouse over the age of 60.

### Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD)
Active-duty service members stationed in Alaska and their families may be eligible for the annual Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) based on specific residency rules.

## Housing & Land Benefits

### Land Discounts and Preference
Alaska offers two unique, once-in-a-lifetime land benefits to eligible resident veterans:
*   **Veteran's Land Discount:** A 25% discount on the purchase price of residential or recreational state land. This does not apply to development or survey costs.
*   **Veteran's Preference Auction:** A bidding preference that allows veterans to be the winning bidder on residentially zoned parcels of five acres or less, even if higher bids are received in the subsequent regular auction.

### Home Mortgages
The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) offers a State Veterans Mortgage Program with lower interest rates for qualifying veterans and service members. Eligible applicants may also receive a 1% interest rate reduction on the first $50,000 of the loan amount.

### Alaska Veterans and Pioneers Home
Located in Palmer, this facility provides affordable, long-term care in a home-like setting for veterans who are Alaska residents, are over 60, and require nursing-level care.

## Recreation & Travel Benefits

### Hunting & Fishing Licenses
Alaska provides several licensing benefits for service members and veterans:
*   **Resident Disabled Veterans:** Free hunting and fishing licenses are available for resident veterans with a VA disability rating of 50% or more.
*   **Resident National Guard & Reserves:** Members actively serving in the Alaska National Guard or Reserves can receive free annual hunting and fishing licenses.
*   **Non-Resident Military:** Active-duty members stationed in Alaska can purchase hunting and fishing licenses at the resident rate.

### Parks & Travel
*   **Disabled Veteran Camping Pass:** A free state park camping pass is available to Alaska resident veterans with a service-connected disability. The pass is valid in all developed Alaska State Park campgrounds.
*   **Alaska Marine Highway System:** Disabled veterans are eligible for a 50% discount on passenger travel on the state ferry system.
*   **Alaska Railroad:** A 20% discount is offered to active-duty military, retired members, veterans, and their dependents.

## Vehicle & Licensing Benefits

*   **Driver's License Designation:** Veterans can have a "Veteran" designation added to their Alaska driver's license or ID card.
*   **Specialty License Plates:** Alaska offers specialty plates for Veterans, Disabled Veterans, Purple Heart recipients, and Gold Star Families.
*   **License Extension:** The driver's licenses of active-duty service members and their spouses stationed outside Alaska remain valid until 90 days after discharge or return to the state.

## Burial & Memorial Benefits

*   **Death Gratuity:** The state provides a $750 death gratuity to the surviving spouse of an eligible veteran.
*   **Free Death Certificates:** Up to four free copies of a veteran's death certificate can be issued.
*   **Grave Medallion:** The VA can provide a medallion to be affixed to a privately purchased headstone, signifying the deceased's veteran status.
*   **National Cemeteries:** VA National Cemeteries are located in Sitka and at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.
