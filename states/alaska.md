## Employment Benefits

Alaska provides several advantages for veterans in public employment, including hiring preferences, retirement credit, and licensing assistance. To receive preference, applicants must first meet the minimum qualifications for the position.

### Hiring Preference
Eligible veterans, service members, and certain family members receive a preference for state government jobs. To be eligible, a veteran must have served 181 days or more on active duty and received an honorable discharge.

*   **Points-Based System:** For hiring processes that use a numerical score, a preference is added to the applicant's passing score.
    *   **5% Preference:** A 5% preference (of the total available points) is added to the score of a veteran or National Guard member.
    *   **10% Preference:** A 10% preference is added for disabled veterans, former POWs, and their eligible unremarried surviving spouses or children.
*   **No Numerical Rating:** In hiring processes without a point system, special consideration is given to veterans. An interview is guaranteed for eligible disabled veterans and former POWs.
*   **Required Documentation:** Applicants must provide proof of eligibility, such as a DD Form 214, a letter from the VA, or a military ID card.

### Retirement & Leave
*   **Military Service Credit:** Veterans vested in the Alaska Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) may purchase up to five years of service credit for their active-duty time. This credit is used to calculate the monthly benefit amount upon retirement.
*   **Leave for Military Duty:** State employees who are members of the National Guard or Reserves are authorized 16.5 days of paid military leave annually for training.

### Professional Licensing
To ease the transition for service members and their spouses, Alaska offers expedited temporary professional licenses, valid for 180 days, to individuals who hold a valid license in another state. The state also accepts military education and training toward meeting the requirements for full licensure.

## Education Benefits

Alaska provides significant state-funded education benefits for service members, National Guard members, and the families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

### Tuition Assistance for Active Military (UAA)
Current active-duty service members, reservists, and National Guard members attending the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) may be eligible for a tuition cap of **$250 per credit hour** and may have all UAA student fees waived. This benefit does not apply to graduate-level tuition or specific course/lab fees and is for the service member only.

### Alaska National Guard Tuition Assistance
Members of the Alaska National Guard may be eligible for state-funded tuition assistance that covers **up to 100% of tuition** and required fees at an approved educational, vocational, or technical training school in Alaska.

### Free Tuition for Spouses & Dependents of Fallen/POW/MIA
Under Alaska Statute § 14.43.085, the state provides a full waiver of undergraduate tuition and fees at state-supported educational institutions for the spouse or dependent of a service member who:
*   Died in the line of duty or from injuries sustained in the line of duty.
*   Was listed by the Department of Defense as a Prisoner of War (POW) or Missing in Action (MIA).

## Tax & Financial Benefits

### Income & Property Tax
*   **No State Income Tax:** Alaska has no state income tax. Military retirement pay, VA disability compensation, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) distributions are not taxed at the state level.
*   **Property Tax Exemption:** Veterans with a VA disability rating of 50% or greater are exempt from property taxes on the first **$150,000 of the assessed value** of their primary residence. This exemption can be transferred to a surviving spouse **over the age of 60**.

### Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD)
Active-duty service members stationed in Alaska and their families may be eligible for the annual Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) based on specific residency rules. The PFD is a unique annual payment to all eligible residents; for example, the 2022 dividend was $3,284 per person.

### Alaska National Guard & Naval Militia Retirement System (NGNMRS)
This state-level retirement system pays eligible service members **$100 per month for each month of satisfactory service** in the Alaska National Guard. If a member dies on active duty with at least five years of service, their full accrued benefit is paid as a lump sum to their beneficiary.

## Housing & Land Benefits

### Land Discounts and Preference
Alaska offers two unique, once-in-a-lifetime land benefits to eligible resident veterans:
*   **Veteran's Land Discount:** A 25% discount on the purchase price of residential or recreational state land. This does not apply to development or survey costs.
*   **Veteran's Preference Auction:** A bidding preference that allows veterans to be the winning bidder on residentially zoned parcels of five acres or less, even if higher bids are received in the subsequent regular auction.

### Home Mortgages
The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation (AHFC) offers a State Veterans Mortgage Program with lower interest rates.
*   **Eligibility:** Applicants must apply to AHFC within **25 years of their discharge date**. The program is for owner-occupied, single-family residences (and with restrictions, duplex, triplex, or fourplex properties).
