# Tennessee Veterans' Preference

The State of Tennessee offers a hiring preference to eligible veterans, their spouses, and surviving spouses for preferred service positions in state government. This preference guarantees an interview and provides an advantage in the hiring process.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Tennessee state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference, an applicant must be one of the following:
*   A veteran who received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Armed Forces. [2]
*   A spouse of a veteran with a 100% service-connected disability or who is permanently and totally disabled. [5]
*   An un-remarried surviving spouse of a service member who died in the line of duty. [5]
*   Spouses and surviving spouses must have been registered voters in Tennessee for at least two years. [5]

## Type of Preference

*   **Guaranteed Interview:** Veterans who meet the minimum qualifications for an open state preferred service position are guaranteed an interview. [1]
*   **Hiring Preference:** If a veteran and a non-veteran applicant are equally qualified for a position, preference must be given to the veteran. [4]
*   **Reduction in Force:** Eligible veterans have 60 months of service credit added to their total state service when determining seniority for RIF purposes. [5]

## How to Apply

1.  Claim veterans' preference on your state employment application.
2.  Provide proof of eligibility, such as your **DD Form 214**, to the Department of Human Resources. [2]
