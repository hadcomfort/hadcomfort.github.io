# Utah Veterans' Preference

The state of Utah provides a veterans' preference points system for qualified individuals seeking initial employment with the state government. The preference is applied to passing scores on examinations or other rating mechanisms.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Utah state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

Preference is provided to applicants who meet any of the following criteria:
*   A veteran or active service member.
*   A veteran or service member with a disability.
*   The spouse or surviving spouse of a qualifying veteran or service member.
*   A Purple Heart recipient.
*   A retired member of the armed forces.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** Preference points are added to the passing score of any examination or rating mechanism.
    *   **5 points** (or 5% of the total possible score) for eligible veterans and service members.
    *   **10 points** (or 10% of the total possible score) for veterans or service members with a disability or Purple Heart recipients.
*   **Spouses:** A spouse or surviving spouse receives the same point preference that the veteran would have been entitled to.
*   **Interview Preference:** If a position does not require an examination, a preference-eligible applicant must be given preference in interviewing for the position.
