# Minnesota Veterans' Preference

Minnesota provides veterans' preference to eligible veterans for public employment in the state, counties, cities, towns, school districts, and other political subdivisions. The preference is governed by Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 197.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Minnesota state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference in Minnesota (as defined in Minnesota Statute 197.447):
* Must be a citizen of the United States or a resident alien.
* Must have been separated under honorable conditions from any branch of the armed forces of the United States.
* Must have served on active duty for 181 consecutive days or by reason of disability incurred while serving on active duty, OR
* Met the minimum active duty requirement as defined by Code of Federal Regulations, title 38, section 3.12a, OR
* Have active military service certified under section 401, Public Law 95-202 (requires certification by the United States Secretary of Defense and an honorable discharge).

## Type of Preference

The preference is applied to competitive open examinations for public employment (Minnesota Statute 197.455):
*   **Nondisabled Veterans:** Receive a credit of 10 points added to their passing examination score.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Receive a credit of 15 points added to their passing examination score. For competitive promotional examinations (first promotion after securing public employment), disabled veterans receive 5 points.
    *   A "disabled veteran" for open examinations has a compensable service-connected disability as adjudicated by the U.S. Veterans Administration or by the retirement board of one of the armed forces branches, existing at the time preference is claimed.
    *   A "disabled veteran" for promotional examinations is entitled to disability compensation for a permanent service-connected disability rated at 50% or more.
*   **Spouses:** Preference may be used by the surviving spouse of a deceased veteran and by the spouse of a disabled veteran who is unable to qualify due to the disability.
*   **Ranking:** Veterans with preference points are ranked ahead of nonveterans with the same examination rating.
*   **Teacher Hiring:** Public schools using a 100-point hiring method must apply the point preferences. Schools not using a 100-point method must grant an interview to any properly licensed veteran applicant.

## How to Apply

*   Veterans must elect to use the preference points.
*   Governmental agencies must notify eligibles of their examination ratings, preference credits, and their right to elect to use the preference.
*   If an appointing authority rejects a certified eligible veteran who has received preference, they must notify the eligible in writing of the reasons for rejection.

## Protections

*   **Removal from Employment (Minnesota Statute 197.46):** After any initial hiring probationary period, a veteran may only be removed from a position for incompetency or misconduct shown after a hearing, upon due notice, and stated charges in writing.
*   **Right to Hearing:** Veterans must be notified of intent to discharge and have 30 days to request a hearing.
*   **Hearing Process:** The veteran can elect to have the hearing before an established civil service board/commission, merit system authority, or an arbitrator. If none exists, an arbitrator will be used.
*   **Appeal Rights:** Decisions can be appealed to the district court.
*   This protection does not apply to positions like private secretary, superintendent of schools, one chief deputy of an elected official/department head, or strictly confidential positions, or teachers.
