# Minnesota Veterans' Preference

The Minnesota Veterans Preference Act (VPA) grants most veterans a limited preference over non-veterans in hiring and promotion for most Minnesota public employment positions.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Minnesota state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans preference, a veteran must be a US citizen or resident alien and have been separated under honorable conditions from any branch of the armed forces of the United States after having served on active duty for 181 consecutive days or more, or by reason of disability incurred while serving on active duty. Spouses of deceased or disabled veterans may also be eligible. [3]

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** For open competitive positions in Minnesota public employment, veterans who receive a passing rating may choose to receive a credit of 10 extra points. Veterans with a compensable service-connected disability may choose to receive a credit of 15 extra points. [2]
*   **Promotional Preference:** For promotional positions, a service-connected disabled veteran with a disability rating of 50% or greater may choose to receive a credit of five extra points on their first promotion. [3]
*   **Interview Preference:** For state and local government positions, the top five recently separated veterans must be granted an interview. [2]

## How to Apply

To claim veterans preference points, you must complete the veteran's preference section of the employment application and provide a copy of your DD214 or other proof of service and discharge. [3] Disabled veterans must also provide a disability letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. [3]
