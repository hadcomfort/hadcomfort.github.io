# West Virginia Veterans' Preference

West Virginia provides a veterans' preference for positions in state agencies and political subdivisions where hiring is done through a civil service or job classification system. The preference adds points to the passing scores of qualified veterans on employment examinations.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official West Virginia state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To receive preference, a veteran's separation from active duty must have been under honorable conditions. This includes both honorable and general discharges. Active duty for training in the reserves or National Guard does not qualify for preference.

## Type of Preference

*   **5-Point Preference:** Awarded to veterans who served on active duty and received an honorable discharge.
*   **10-Point Preference:** Awarded to veterans who have a compensable, service-connected disability or who have received a Purple Heart. This is an additional 5 points on top of the base 5-point preference.
*   **Application:** Preference points are added only to a passing score on an examination. An applicant's experience in the armed forces must also be credited to meet qualification requirements.

## How to Apply

Applicants must indicate their veteran status when applying for state jobs. Proof of service dates, disability, or a Purple Heart award, as verified by a DD Form 214 or a letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs, is required before credit can be given.
