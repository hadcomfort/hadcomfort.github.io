# Puerto Rico Veterans' Preference

The "Bill of Rights of the XXI Century Veteran of Puerto Rico" grants employment rights and preferences to veterans for appointment, promotion, or other employment opportunities within the government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Commonwealth of Puerto Rico resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

An eligible individual is any person who has served honorably in the Armed Forces of the United States, its reserves, or the Puerto Rico National Guard, and who is considered a veteran by law.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** An extra 10 points or 10% (whichever is greater) is added to the passing score obtained by a veteran in any employment or promotion test.
*   **Hiring and Promotion Preference:** Under equal academic and technical conditions or experience, a veteran must be given preference for any appointment, job, or promotion opportunity.
*   **Reinstatement Rights:** A veteran has the right to be reinstated to the same position held before being called to active duty (or a similar one) if they request it within 180 days of separation.

## How to Apply

Veterans should declare their status when applying for government positions. To receive points on an examination or preference in hiring, you will be required to provide documentation of your military service and honorable discharge.
