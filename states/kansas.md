# Kansas Veterans' Preference

Kansas law provides for veterans' preference in public employment for eligible veterans. The preference is applied to competitive examinations for appointments and promotions in the state's classified service. The program is managed by the Kansas Department of Administration.

*   The spouse of a 100% disabled veteran.
*   The unremarried surviving spouse of a deceased veteran.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based System:** Preference is granted by adding points to the final passing score on a competitive examination.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Veterans with a compensable service-connected disability are awarded 10 preference points.
*   **Non-Disabled Veterans:** Eligible non-disabled veterans are awarded 5 preference points.
*   **Spouses and Surviving Spouses:** Eligible spouses and surviving spouses are awarded 10 preference points.
*   **Guaranteed Interview:** Any veteran who meets the eligibility criteria and the minimum qualifications for a position is guaranteed an interview.

## How to Apply

1.  Applicants must indicate their request for veterans' preference when applying for a state position through the official State of Kansas job portal.
