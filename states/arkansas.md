# Arkansas Veterans' Preference

Arkansas provides a veterans' preference for qualified veterans, their spouses, and surviving spouses in hiring, promotion, and retention for state employment. [2, 5] The preference is applied when considering candidates for interviews and in the final selection. [2]

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Arkansas state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, an applicant must be a citizen and resident of Arkansas and have substantially equal qualifications to other applicants. [3, 6] The preference applies to:
*   **Veterans:** Honorably discharged from a tour of active duty (not for training). [3]
*   **National Guard/Reserves:** Any person who has served honorably for at least six years in the National Guard or reserve forces. [3, 6]
*   **Disabled Veterans:** A veteran with a service-connected disability. [2]
*   **Unmarried Surviving Spouses:** The surviving spouse of a deceased veteran, provided they are unmarried at the time of application and hiring. [3]

## Type of Preference

*   **Absolute Preference (Tie-Breaker):** When qualifications are substantially equal, preference is given to the veteran.
*   **Points-Based (If Scored):** If an examination or other scored instrument is used, 5 points are added to the final earned rating of an eligible applicant who achieves a passing grade. [3]
*   **Promotion and Retention:** A veteran's status must be considered in decisions regarding promotions and retention during a reduction in force. [2, 3]

## How to Apply

An applicant must voluntarily submit official proof of their status, such as a DD-214 or a letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, to the hiring supervisor by the end of the job interview. [4]
