# Arkansas Veterans' Benefits and Preference

The state of Arkansas offers several benefits to its veterans, including a hiring preference for state employment, two state-run veterans' homes, and two state veterans' cemeteries. The Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs (ADVA) provides advocacy and assistance to help veterans and their families access these state benefits as well as federal benefits.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary based on available research. Benefits and regulations can change. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Arkansas state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs (ADVA)

Established in 1923, the ADVA is the primary state agency dedicated to serving Arkansas's veterans and their eligible dependents. Its mission is to provide access to state and federal benefits, ensure high-quality long-term nursing care, and offer dignified burial honors.

## Employment Preference and Resources

### State Employment Hiring Preference
Arkansas provides a veterans' preference for qualified veterans, their spouses, and surviving spouses in hiring, promotion, and retention for state employment. The preference is applied when developing the list of candidates to be interviewed and again when making the final selection.

#### Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, an applicant must be a citizen and resident of Arkansas and have qualifications substantially equal to other applicants. An applicant entitled to preference cannot be disqualified due to age or physical disability, provided it does not hinder their ability to perform the job duties. The preference applies to:

*   **Veterans:** A person honorably discharged from a tour of active duty, which cannot be for training purposes only.
*   **National Guard/Reserves:** Any person who has served honorably for at least six years in the National Guard or reserve forces.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** A veteran with a service-connected disability established by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. This includes veterans over age 55 who are entitled to a pension or compensation.
*   **Spouses of Disabled Veterans:** The spouse of a disabled veteran whose disability disqualifies them from being selected for the position.
*   **Unmarried Surviving Spouses:** The surviving spouse of a deceased qualified veteran, provided they are unmarried at the time of application and hiring.

#### Type of Preference

Preference is applied differently depending on whether a numerical scoring system is used for hiring.

*   **When a Numerical Score is Used:** If an examination or other scored evaluation is used to create a list of qualified candidates, points are added to the final passing score of an eligible applicant.
    *   **5 points** are added for eligible veterans, members of the National Guard/Reserves, and their unmarried surviving spouses.
    *   **10 points** are added for disabled veterans or the spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified from the position due to their disability.

*   **When a Numerical Score is Not Used:** The hiring authority must be able to demonstrate how veteran's preference was applied in developing the list of candidates to be interviewed and in selecting the final candidate.

*   **Promotion and Retention:** A qualified veteran's status must be considered in decisions regarding promotions. In a reduction-in-force scenario, a veteran's status is counted as part of the employee's seniority.

#### How to Apply and Applicant Rights

An applicant must voluntarily submit official proof of their status, such as a DD-214 or a letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, to the hiring authority to receive preference.

If an applicant eligible for veteran's preference is not hired, they may request that the hiring authority provide the reason in writing.
*   If scoring was used, the applicant can request their base score, their adjusted score, and the successful candidate's score.
*   If no scoring was used, the applicant can request all documentation demonstrating how preference was applied to develop the interview list and select the successful candidate.

### Private Employer Preference

Arkansas law permits private-sector employers to voluntarily create and implement their own veterans' preference policy. If an employer adopts such a policy, it must be applied uniformly to decisions regarding hiring, promotion, and retention. The state maintains a registry of private employers that have adopted a veterans' preference policy, which can be a valuable resource for job-seeking veterans.

## Education Benefits

Veterans in Arkansas can use federal education programs like the Post-9/11 GI BillÂ®. However, specific information regarding additional state-funded education benefits, such as tuition waivers or scholarships for veterans or their dependents, was not detailed in the available research.

Veterans are encouraged to contact the **Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs (ADVA)** directly to inquire about any available state-level educational assistance.

## Housing Assistance

### Arkansas State Veterans Homes

ADVA operates two State Veterans Homes that provide long-term, skilled nursing care. Personal laundry service and cable television are provided at no additional charge.

**Eligibility:** Admission is open to honorably discharged veterans, their spouses, and Gold Star parents who have an established medical need for nursing home care.

### Home Loans and Homelessness Support

Information on specific state-sponsored home loan or homeless veteran support programs was not available in the resources reviewed. Veterans seeking assistance are encouraged to explore federal resources such as the **VA Home Loan Guaranty** program and the **VA's homeless assistance programs**. Your local VSO can provide guidance on accessing these federal benefits.

## Financial Benefits and Tax Exemptions

Many states offer property tax exemptions or vehicle registration discounts for eligible veterans. However, specific details on these types of financial benefits for Arkansas veterans were not available in the research materials. Veterans should contact their local **County Assessor's office** for property tax information and **ADVA** for guidance on any other available state financial benefits.
