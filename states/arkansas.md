# Arkansas Veterans' Preference

Arkansas provides a veterans' preference for qualified veterans, their spouses, and surviving spouses in hiring, promotion, and retention for state employment. The preference is applied when considering candidates for interviews and in the final selection.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Arkansas state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, an applicant must be a citizen and resident of Arkansas and have substantially equal qualifications to other applicants. The preference applies to:

*   **Veterans:** A person honorably discharged from a tour of active duty (not for training) with the United States Armed Forces.
*   **National Guard/Reserves:** Any person who has served honorably for at least six years in the National Guard or reserve forces of the United States.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** A veteran with a service-connected disability established by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
*   **Spouses of Disabled Veterans:** The spouse of a disabled veteran whose disability disqualifies them from being selected for the position.
*   **Unmarried Surviving Spouses:** The surviving spouse of a deceased qualified veteran, provided they are unmarried at the time of application and hiring.

An applicant entitled to preference cannot be disqualified from a position because of age or physical disability, as long as the age or disability does not prevent them from properly performing the job duties.

## Type of Preference

*   **When a numerical score is used:** If an examination or other scored evaluation is used to create a list of qualified candidates, points are added to the final passing score of an eligible applicant.
    *   **5 points** are added for eligible veterans, members of the National Guard/Reserves, and their unmarried surviving spouses.
    *   **10 points** are added for disabled veterans or the spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified from the position due to their disability.
*   **When a numerical score is not used:** The hiring authority must be able to demonstrate how veteran's preference was applied in developing the list of candidates to be interviewed and in selecting the final candidate.
*   **Promotion and Retention:** A qualified veteran's status must be considered in decisions regarding promotions and retention during a reduction in force. In a reduction-in-force scenario, a veteran's status is counted as part of the employee's seniority.

## How to Apply

An applicant must voluntarily submit official proof of their status, such as a DD-214 or a letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, to the hiring authority. If an eligible applicant who is a veteran is not hired, they can request documentation from the hiring authority explaining how the preference was applied.
