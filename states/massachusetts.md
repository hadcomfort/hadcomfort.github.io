# Massachusetts Veterans' Preference

Massachusetts provides a strong veterans' preference for civil service appointments. Under state law, veterans are given preference over non-veterans in placement on eligible lists for civil service positions.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Massachusetts state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference, an individual must be defined as a "veteran" under Massachusetts General Laws. This generally requires:
*   At least 90 days of active duty service, with at least one day during wartime.
*   An honorable discharge or release under honorable conditions.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Veterans with a service-connected disability of 10% or more as determined by the VA.

## Type of Preference

*   **Absolute Preference:** For open competitive examinations for initial appointment, disabled veterans who pass the exam are placed at the very top of the eligible list, ranked in order of their scores. Following them, all other eligible veterans are placed above non-veterans.
*   **Two-Point Preference:** For promotional examinations within the civil service, a veteran is granted an additional two points on their score, provided they achieve a passing grade.
*   **Order of Placement:** The order on an eligible list is: 1) Disabled Veterans, 2) Veterans, 3) All other candidates.

## How to Apply

1.  Candidates must claim veterans' preference when applying for a civil service examination.
2.  Proof of eligibility, including the DD Form 214 (Member 4 copy) and a VA disability letter (if applicable), must be submitted to the state's Civil Service Unit.
3.  The Civil Service Unit reviews the documentation and determines the applicant's preference status, which is then applied to the eligible lists.
