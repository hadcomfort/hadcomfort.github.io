# Mississippi Veterans' Preference

Mississippi provides veterans' preference to eligible veterans for state employment. The Mississippi State Personnel Board (MSPB) oversees the state's personnel system and application of these preferences.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Mississippi state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

Eligibility for veterans' preference in Mississippi is defined in Mississippi Code Section 25-9-301:

*   **Veteran (Section 25-9-301(a)):**
    *   An individual who served on active duty in any branch of the United States Armed Forces for at least ninety (90) consecutive days during a time of war or armed conflict and was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable.
    *   OR, an individual who was discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected injury or disability in less than ninety (90) days.
*   **Disabled Veteran (Section 25-9-301(b)):**
    *   An individual who has established the present existence of a service-connected disability of thirty percent (30%) or more, as certified by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, within ninety (90) days of the date of application for employment.
    *   OR, an individual who was awarded the Purple Heart medal.

## Type of Preference

When the Mississippi State Personnel Board (MSPB) provides lists of eligible applicants to state agencies:
*   Qualified disabled veterans are placed at the top of the list.
*   Qualified veterans (who are not disabled veterans) are placed at the top of the list, following any disabled veterans.

This means that eligible veterans who meet the minimum qualifications for a position are given priority consideration.

## How to Apply

Applicants should indicate their veteran status on their employment application submitted through the Mississippi State Personnel Board. The preference is generally applied by the MSPB when generating lists of eligible candidates for state agencies.
