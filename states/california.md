# California Veterans' Benefits and Resources

The State of California, through the California Department of Veterans Affairs (CalVet) and its county partners, offers a wide range of benefits and services to honor and support its veterans and their families. This guide provides a summary of major programs, from state employment preference to education, housing, and financial benefits.

## State Employment Preference

California provides a significant advantage to eligible veterans and their spouses in the state civil service hiring process. This preference is applied to open and open, non-promotional examinations.

### Eligibility and Type of Preference

*   **Top Rank Preference:** Effective since January 1, 2014, any eligible veteran, the widow or widower of a veteran, or the spouse of a 100% disabled veteran who achieves a passing score on an entrance examination is placed in the **top rank** of the resulting eligibility list. This is a powerful preference that places qualified candidates among the first to be considered for a position.
*   **Who is Eligible:**
    *   Veterans with an honorable discharge or release.
    *   The spouse of a 100% service-connected disabled veteran.
    *   The unremarried widow or widower of a veteran.
*   **Career-Long Benefit:** The preference is a "one-time" benefit. Once a veteran achieves permanent civil service status, they cannot use the preference again. Its goal is to help with initial entry into state service.
*   **Promotional Exams:** Individuals honorably discharged or retired from the military are eligible to compete in state promotional examinations, provided they meet the minimum qualifications.

### How to Apply for Preference

1.  Obtain a **Veteran's Preference Application Form (SPB 1093)**.
2.  Submit the completed form along with a legible copy of your **DD Form 214** (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty). Spouses and surviving spouses will need to provide additional documentation as specified on the form.
3.  Mail the application to:
    **California Department of Human Resources (CalHR)**
    Attn: Exam Services
    1515 "S" Street, North Building, Suite 400
    Sacramento, CA 95811

## Job Search and Career Resources

Beyond the hiring preference, California offers robust employment services to help veterans find meaningful careers.

*   **Employment Development Department (EDD):** Local EDD offices have dedicated veterans' representatives who provide customized job search assistance, job fairs, and employer recruitment events. Veterans receive a 24-hour priority hold on all new job listings.
*   **Disabled Veteran Outreach Program (DVOP):** DVOP specialists provide intensive services and career coaching to veterans with significant barriers to employment to help improve their employability.
*   **Local Veterans' Employment Representatives (LVERs):** LVER staff conduct outreach to employers, run job search workshops, and provide job development contacts to facilitate veteran hiring.
*   **Apprenticeship and On-the-Job Training (OJT):** Veterans can use their GI Bill® benefits for approved OJT and apprenticeship programs, allowing them to earn a wage while learning a new trade.
*   **Office of Small Business and DVBE:** For veteran entrepreneurs, this office provides certification assistance and advocacy for small businesses and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises (DVBEs).
