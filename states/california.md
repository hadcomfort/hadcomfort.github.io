# California Veterans' Preference

California provides veterans' preference to eligible veterans, their spouses, and surviving spouses for state civil service employment examinations. The preference is administered by the California Department of Human Resources (CalHR).

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official California state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, a veteran must have a service-connected disability of 0% or more, or have served on active duty during a qualifying war period or campaign. Specific criteria include:
*   **Veterans:** Must have served at least 30 consecutive days of active duty and received an honorable discharge.
*   **Spouses of Disabled Veterans:** The spouse of a 100% disabled veteran may also be eligible.
*   **Surviving Spouses:** A surviving spouse of a veteran who met the eligibility criteria may also qualify.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** Eligible veterans have points added to their passing scores on open and open, non-promotional examinations.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Receive 15 preference points.
*   **All Other Eligible Veterans:** Receive 10 preference points.
*   **Spouses/Surviving Spouses:** Eligible spouses and surviving spouses receive 10 preference points.
*   **Career-Long Benefit:** Once a veteran achieves permanent civil service status, they cannot use the preference points again.

## How to Apply

1.  Obtain a **Veterans' Preference Application (CalHR Form 1093)** from the CalHR website.
2.  Submit the completed form along with required documentation (such as DD Form 214 and VA disability letters) to CalHR.
3.  Once approved, the preference is applied to examinations for which the veteran qualifies and achieves a passing score.
