# New Jersey Veterans' Preference

New Jersey's merit system provides absolute veterans preference in employee selection. This means that qualified veterans are placed at the top of an open competitive employment list ahead of non-veterans regardless of their scores. [2]

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official New Jersey state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for Veterans Preference, the Veteran must have served on active duty during a qualifying war era and received an honorable discharge. [3] The spouse of a disabled veteran and the surviving spouse of a veteran may also be eligible. [3]

## Type of Preference

*   **Absolute Preference:** Qualified veterans who receive a passing score are placed at the top of open competitive employment lists, ahead of Non-Veterans, regardless of their scores. [3]
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Disabled Veterans are given the highest preference, being placed above both Veterans and Non-Veterans on open competitive employment lists. [3]
*   **Promotional Preference:** Veterans who are state employees are given preference for promotion over non-Veterans. [5]

## How to Apply
