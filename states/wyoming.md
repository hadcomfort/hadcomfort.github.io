# Wyoming Veterans' Preference

Wyoming provides a hiring preference for initial employment to eligible veterans and their surviving spouses in all public departments, including the state, counties, cities, school districts, and the University of Wyoming.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Wyoming state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, an applicant must be:
*   **A Veteran:** An honorably discharged member of the U.S. military establishment who has been a resident of Wyoming for one year or more at any time prior to applying.
*   **A Surviving Spouse:** The person who was married to a veteran at the time of the veteran's death and who receives federal survivor benefits based on the veteran's service.
*   The preference does not apply to a veteran who is currently employed by a public department.

## Type of Preference

*   **Interview Preference:** Eligible veterans and surviving spouses who meet the minimum qualifications for a position are guaranteed an interview.
*   **Points-Based Advantage:** For departments that use a numerical scoring system before the interview, an advantage is added to the score:
    *   **5% advantage** for an eligible veteran or surviving spouse.
    *   **10% advantage** for a veteran with a service-connected disability of 10% or more.
*   If no numerical score is used, a similar advantage must be reasonably approximated in the process.

## How to Apply

Applicants must provide appropriate documentation of veteran status and residency at the time of application to receive the preference.
