# Oregon Veterans' Preference

Oregon law requires public employers to provide a preference to eligible veterans and disabled veterans at each stage of the hiring process for civil service positions.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Oregon state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference, an applicant must be a veteran who was discharged or released under honorable conditions and meets specific service criteria, such as:
*   Served more than 178 consecutive days.
*   Served for 178 days or less and was released due to a service-connected disability.
*   Served at least one day in a combat zone.
*   Received a campaign or expeditionary medal.
*   Is receiving a non-service-connected pension from the VA.

A disabled veteran is someone entitled to VA disability compensation or who was discharged for a disability incurred in the line of duty.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based Preference:**
    *   **5 points** are added to the score of an eligible veteran on any initial screening or examination.
    *   **10 points** are added to the score of an eligible disabled veteran. [3]
*   **Interview Requirement:** If an interview is part of the selection process, a public employer must interview every veteran who meets the minimum and any special qualifications for the position. [2]
*   **Appointment:** If a veteran's final score (with preference points) is equal to or higher than a non-veteran's, the veteran must be appointed. [5]
