# Louisiana Veterans' Preference

Louisiana provides a veterans' preference in its State Civil Service system for eligible veterans and other qualifying individuals. The preference is applied to both original appointments and promotional opportunities within the state classified service.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Louisiana state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

Eligibility is granted to veterans who have served honorably on active duty. Specific requirements apply based on the preference type:
*   **Five-Point Preference:** Granted to veterans who served honorably during specified wartime periods or in a qualifying campaign or expedition.
*   **Ten-Point Preference:** Granted to veterans with a service-connected disability as determined by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. This preference also extends to spouses of veterans who are unemployable due to a service-connected disability, unremarried surviving spouses of deceased veterans, and certain other specific categories.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based System:** Eligible individuals have preference points added to their final passing scores on civil service examinations.
*   **Five-Point Preference:** Awarded for original appointments.
*   **Ten-Point Preference:** Awarded for original appointments.
*   **Promotional Preference:** Veterans who are already state employees are awarded a three-point preference on promotional examinations.

## How to Apply

1.  Applicants must claim the preference at the time of application for a civil service position.
2.  The application must be accompanied by proof of service, such as a DD Form 214.
3.  For disability preference, a letter from the VA certifying the service-connected disability is required.
4.  Documents should be submitted to the Louisiana State Civil Service department for verification.
