# Missouri Veterans' Preference

Missouri provides a veterans' preference in state employment for veterans, their surviving spouses, disabled veterans, and the spouses of disabled veterans. [2]

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Missouri state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

Any person who has been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces of the United States is eligible for veterans' preference. [2]

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** In any competitive examination for the purpose of establishing a register of eligibles, veterans, disabled veterans, surviving spouses and spouses of disabled veterans are given preference. [2] Veterans receive a 5-point preference when testing for a state position. [5] Service-connected disabled veterans receive 10 points. [5]
*   **Tie-Breaker:** A veteran, or the surviving spouse of a veteran, a disabled veteran, or the spouse of a disabled veteran will be given preference in appointment to a position over other eligibles if all other relevant job-related factors are equal. [2]

## How to Apply

Applicants should ensure that their military experience is included in every application they submit for employment with the state of Missouri. [3]
