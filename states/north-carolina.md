# North Carolina Veterans' Preference

North Carolina provides a hiring preference to eligible veterans and their spouses for positions in state government. The preference applies to initial employment, promotions, reassignments, and in reduction-in-force situations.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official North Carolina state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference, a person must be a veteran who served on active duty (for reasons other than training) and was discharged under other than dishonorable conditions. [2]

An "eligible veteran" includes:
*   A veteran who served during a period of war.
*   The spouse of a disabled veteran.
*   The surviving spouse or dependent of a veteran who died on active duty during a period of war.
*   A veteran who suffered a service-connected disability during peacetime.
*   The spouse of a veteran with a service-connected disability from peacetime service.
*   The surviving spouse or dependent of a service member who died for service-related reasons during peacetime.

## Type of Preference

*   **Priority in Hiring:** Eligible veterans are given priority in employment consideration when they have substantially equal qualifications to other applicants. [4]
*   **Military Service Credit:** Credit is given for military training and experience that relates to the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the position. [3]
*   **Reduction-in-Force (RIF):** Eligible veterans are granted one year of state service for each year of military service (up to five years) when calculating length of service for RIF purposes. [2]

## How to Apply

1.  Submit a **DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty)** with your State Application for Employment (Form PD-107 or through the online applicant tracking system). [2]
2.  The hiring agency is responsible for verifying the applicant's eligibility for preference. [2]
3.  Applicants must meet the minimum qualifications for the position to be eligible for preference.
