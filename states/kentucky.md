# Kentucky Veterans' Preference

Kentucky provides a hiring preference to honorably discharged veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces for initial appointments to state government jobs in the executive branch. The preference is administered by the Kentucky Personnel Cabinet.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Kentucky state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for preference, an individual must meet the following criteria:
*   Have served on active duty in any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.

The preference also extends to:
*   Spouses of a 100% service-connected disabled veteran.
*   Unremarried surviving spouses of a deceased veteran.
*   Members of the National Guard or Reserves.

## Type of Preference

*   **Five-Point Preference:** Five points are added to the applicant's score on the competitive examination or register.
*   **Ten-Point Preference:** Ten points are added for veterans with a service-connected disability, regardless of the disability percentage.
*   **Non-Competitive Positions:** For jobs that do not require an examination, veteran status is considered a positive factor in the selection process.

## How to Apply

2.  Submit the form along with a copy of your DD Form 214 (Member 4 copy) and, if applicable, a VA disability letter.
