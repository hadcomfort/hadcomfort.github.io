# Georgia Veterans' Benefits and Resources

The State of Georgia demonstrates a strong commitment to its veterans and their families through a wide range of benefits and support services administered by the **Georgia Department of Veterans Service (GDVS)**. The GDVS serves as the central point of contact and advocacy, working to ensure veterans can access the full benefits they have earned.

This guide summarizes employment preferences, tax benefits, educational programs, and other key resources available to veterans in Georgia.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Georgia state government resources and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Contact information is provided at the bottom of this page.

## Georgia Department of Veterans Service (GDVS)

The primary mission of the GDVS is to advise, counsel, and assist Georgia's veterans and their families. They offer claims assistance, information on education and training, and manage state veterans cemeteries.

*   **Primary Phone:** (404) 656-2300
*   **Email:** gavetsvc@vs.ga.gov
*   **Main Office:** Floyd Veterans Memorial Building, Suite E-970, Atlanta, GA 30334-4800
*   **Key Initiatives:**
    *   **Unite Georgia:** A coordinated care network that connects veterans and their families directly with local resources for employment, education, housing, food security, mental health, and more, aiming to reduce wait times from weeks to days.
    *   **Returning Veterans Task Force:** A collaboration with other state agencies to better address the challenges veterans face when transitioning to civilian life.

## Veterans' Preference in Public Employment

Georgia provides veterans' preference for initial appointments in public employment by adding points to examination scores or by giving preference in non-examined hiring processes. This preference does not guarantee a job but provides an advantage in the selection process.

### Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference in Georgia, an applicant must be:
*   A veteran with a discharge under honorable conditions.
*   The spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified for the position due to their disability.
*   The unmarried surviving spouse (widow/widower) of a deceased veteran.
*   Seeking an initial appointment with the State of Georgia or a political subdivision.

### How Preference is Awarded

The application of preference depends on the hiring process for the position.

#### For Positions with a Scored Exam

Points are added to the passing scores of competitive pre-employment examinations.

*   **10-Point Credit:** Awarded to:
    *   Veterans with a VA-rated service-connected disability of at least 10%.
    *   Veterans over age 55 who are entitled to a pension or compensation due to a disability.
    *   The qualified spouse of a disabled veteran, if the veteran is disqualified from the job due to their disability.
    *   The unmarried surviving spouse of a deceased veteran from any period of armed conflict.

*   **5-Point Credit:** Awarded to:
    *   Veterans who served on active duty during a wartime period or for at least 180 consecutive days.
    *   Members of the National Guard or Armed Forces Reserve who served on U.S. active duty during Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom.
    *   Members of the National Guard or Armed Forces Reserve who served on U.S. active duty during Operation Desert Shield or Operation Desert Storm in specified imminent danger areas.

#### For Positions without a Scored Exam

*   When hiring agencies do not use numerically scored exams, preference is given to eligible veterans whose qualifications are **equal to those of non-veteran applicants**. Some local governments, like Fulton County, extend this preference as a guaranteed invitation to interview for any veteran who meets all knowledge, skills, and eligibility requirements for the job.

### Private Employers

*   Georgia law also authorizes private employers to establish a written policy for a veterans' hiring preference.

### How to Apply for Preference

*   Applicants must indicate their veteran status on the employment application.
*   Provide proof of eligibility, such as a **DD Form 214**, to document service and discharge status.
*   For a 10-point credit, veterans must provide official documentation from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs verifying their service-connected disability.
