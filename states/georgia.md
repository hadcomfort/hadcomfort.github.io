# Georgia Veterans' Preference

Georgia provides a veterans' preference for state employment opportunities by adding points to the scores of competitive examinations. This benefit is extended to certain veterans and their spouses in recognition of their service.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Georgia state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for veterans' preference in Georgia, an individual must be a veteran, the spouse of a disabled veteran, or the unmarried surviving spouse of a deceased veteran. The veteran must have been discharged under honorable conditions.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** Georgia offers preference by adding points to the passing scores of pre-employment examinations.
*   **5-Point Credit:** Awarded to veterans who served on active duty during a wartime period or for at least 180 consecutive days.
*   **10-Point Credit:** Awarded to veterans with a VA-rated service-connected disability.
*   **Non-Examined Positions:** When hiring agencies do not use numerically scored exams, preference is given to eligible veterans whose qualifications are equal to those of non-veteran applicants. [2]
*   **Private Employers:** Georgia law also authorizes private employers to establish a written policy for a veterans' hiring preference. [2]

## How to Apply

*   Applicants must provide proof of eligibility, such as a DD Form 214, to document their service and discharge status.
*   For a 10-point credit, veterans must provide official documentation from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs verifying their service-connected disability.
