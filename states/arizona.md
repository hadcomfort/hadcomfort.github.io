# Arizona Veterans' Benefits and Services

The State of Arizona, through the Arizona Department of Veterans' Services (ADVS) and partner agencies, offers a comprehensive suite of benefits and services to honor and support its veterans and their families. This guide covers key benefits including public employment preference, education programs, housing assistance, tax benefits, and other vital resources.

**Disclaimer:** This is a comprehensive summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Arizona state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

# Employment Preference & Resources

Arizona provides a robust support system for veteran employment, which includes a statutory hiring preference for public jobs and a wide array of job search and training resources.

## Public Employment Hiring Preference (A.R.S. § 38-492)

In accordance with state law, Arizona provides a points-based preference to qualified veterans, disabled veterans, and certain spouses for employment with the state and its political subdivisions that operate under a merit system.

*   **Scope and Application:** The hiring preference is available to external candidates applying for positions. It does not apply to current state employees. Preference points are added to an applicant's final passing score on an examination. To be eligible, an applicant must first meet the minimum qualifications for the position and achieve a passing score on the examination.

*   **Eligibility and Points:**
    *   **Veterans (5 Points):** Must have served on active duty for more than six months and been separated under honorable conditions. Former reserve component service members eligible for military retirement pay also qualify.
    *   **Disabled Veterans (10 Points):** Must have an honorable discharge and a service-connected disability, or be receiving compensation or disability retirement benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or a military retirement board.
    *   **Spouses/Surviving Spouses (5 Points):** This applies to the spouse of a veteran with a total and permanent service-connected disability; the surviving spouse of a veteran who died of a service-connected disability; or the spouse of a service member listed for over 90 days as missing in action, captured, or forcibly detained.

*   **How to Claim Preference:**
    Applicants must submit required documentation to the Arizona Department of Administration (ADOA) Human Resources division. This documentation only needs to be submitted once.
    1.  **Required Documents:** A copy of your DD Form 214 and, for disabled veterans, certification from the Veteran's Administration (such as Form FL-802).
    2.  **Submission:** Can be uploaded online at [azstatejobs.gov](https://azstatejobs.gov), faxed to (602) 542-4745, or emailed to staffing@azdoa.gov. Contact ADOA HR at (602) 542-5482 for questions.

## Job Search Assistance & Training Programs

*   **Department of Economic Security (DES):** Offers priority access to employment and training services for veterans and eligible spouses with significant barriers to employment.
*   **Civilian Credentialing Assistance (IgnitED):** ADVS promotes this Army tool which helps service members map their military skills and jobs to civilian credentials and outlines the required training to achieve them.
*   **Employer Incentives:** Arizona promotes federal programs like the **Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC)** and the **HIRE Vets Medallion Program** to encourage private-sector businesses to recruit, hire, and retain veterans.
*   **Voluntary Private Employer Preference:** Arizona law allows private employers to adopt their own voluntary veterans' preference policies for hiring and promotion.
