# Arizona Veterans' Preference

In accordance with Arizona Revised Statute (A.R.S.) ยง 38-492, the State of Arizona provides a points-based preference to qualified veterans, disabled veterans, and certain spouses for employment with the state and its political subdivisions. This policy recognizes the valuable contributions of military service members and aims to assist them in securing public service careers.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Arizona state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Scope and Application of Preference

The hiring preference is available to external candidates applying for positions with the State of Arizona or its political subdivisions that operate under a merit system. It does not apply to current state employees. Preference points are added to an applicant's final passing score on an examination.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for preference points, an applicant must first meet the minimum qualifications for the position and achieve a passing score on any examination before the points are applied.

*   **Veterans:** Receive **5 preference points**. To qualify, a veteran must have served on active duty for more than six months and have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions. Former reserve component service members who are eligible for military retirement pay also qualify.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Receive **10 preference points**. A disabled veteran must have an honorable discharge and a service-connected disability, or be receiving compensation or disability retirement benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or a military retirement board.
*   **Spouses/Surviving Spouses:** Receive **5 preference points**. This applies to:
    *   The spouse of a veteran with a total and permanent service-connected disability.
    *   The surviving spouse of a veteran who died of a service-connected disability.
    *   The spouse of a service member listed for over 90 days as missing in action, captured, or forcibly detained by a foreign power.

## How to Apply

Applicants must submit required documentation to the Arizona Department of Administration (ADOA) Human Resources division to claim preference. This documentation only needs to be submitted once and will be kept on file for future applications.

1.  **Required Documents:**
    *   A copy of your DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).
    *   For disabled veterans, certification from the Veteran's Administration (such as Form FL-802) or an equivalent letter from a service retirement board is required.
2.  **Submission Methods:**
    *   **Online:** Upload to your profile at [azstatejobs.gov](https://azstatejobs.gov).
    *   **Fax:** (602) 542-4745.
    *   **Email:** staffing@azdoa.gov.

## Other State Employment Resources for Veterans

Beyond the hiring preference, Arizona offers several other programs and resources to support veterans in their careers:

*   **Veteran Toolkit Program:** The Arizona Department of Veterans' Services (ADVS) provides unemployed veterans with necessary work supplies, such as clothing, tools, or protective equipment, to help them start a job.
*   **Priority of Service:** The Arizona Department of Economic Security (DES) offers priority access to employment and training services for veterans and eligible spouses with significant barriers to employment.
*   **"Gold Card" Initiative:** This national program, available at Arizona's American Job Centers, provides post-9/11 veterans with six months of intensive follow-up and career guidance services.
*   **Troops to Educators:** This program assists service members, veterans, and their spouses in completing the certification process for careers in K-12 education.
*   **Voluntary Private Employer Preference:** Arizona law allows private employers to adopt their own voluntary veterans' preference policies.
