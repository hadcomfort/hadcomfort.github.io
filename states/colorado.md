# Colorado Veteran Benefits & Preference

Colorado offers a structured framework of benefits and resources to support its veteran population and their families. State-led initiatives, managed by the **Colorado Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMVA)** and its **Division of Veterans Affairs (DVA)**, work in tandem with federal resources like the **Denver VA Regional Benefit Office** to provide comprehensive support.

For personalized assistance navigating both state and federal benefits, veterans are strongly encouraged to contact their local **County Veteran Service Officer (CVSO)**. These accredited officers are a primary resource for understanding eligibility and applying for the benefits outlined below.

**Disclaimer:** This page provides a summary of benefits. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official state and federal resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Veterans' Preference in Public Employment

Colorado provides a constitutionally mandated veterans' preference to give qualified veterans an advantage in the initial hiring process for state government positions.

### Constitutional Basis
The preference is enshrined in the **Colorado Constitution (Article XII, Section 15)**. This provides a strong guarantee of these benefits but also means that its limitations, such as the exclusion for promotions, are firmly established and difficult to change.

### Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, an applicant must have an honorable discharge and meet one of the following criteria:

*   **Veterans:** Served on active duty during a time of war or armed conflict recognized by the U.S. Congress, or received a campaign badge or service medal.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** Have a service-connected disability or are receiving VA pension or disability retirement benefits.
*   **Spouses:** The spouse of a veteran who is unable to work because of a service-connected disability.
*   **Surviving Spouses:** The widow or widower of a deceased veteran who was, or would have been, entitled to the preference.

### Type of Preference

Points are added to a passing score on a competitive examination.

*   **5 Preference Points:** Awarded to eligible veterans, spouses, and surviving spouses.
*   **10 Preference Points:** Awarded to veterans who have a service-connected disability and are receiving VA disability compensation or a pension.

### Limitations

*   **No Preference for Promotions:** Per the state constitution, this preference does not apply to promotions or any job opening considered a promotional opportunity.
*   **Initial Hire Only:** The preference provides an advantage for initial entry into state employment, but career advancement thereafter is based on merit and performance.

### How to Claim Preference

Applicants must claim the preference on their state job application and attach the required documentation.

*   **Required Documents:**
    *   A copy of your **DD Form 214** (Member-4 copy is recommended) showing the character of service as "Honorable."
    *   For disabled veteran preference, a **letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)** verifying a service-connected disability is required in addition to the DD-214.

### Veterans' Preference Summary

| Preference Type | Eligibility Criteria (Summary)                                                                                | Required Documentation                                       | Scope                |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| **5-Point**     | Honorably separated veteran (wartime service or campaign medal); spouse of veteran unable to work due to SC disability; widow/er of eligible veteran. | DD-214 (Member 4)                                            | Initial Hire/Retention |

## Financial Benefits & Tax Exemptions

### Property Tax Exemption
A property tax exemption is available for veterans with a **100% permanent and total service-connected disability rating**. This exempts 50% of the first $200,000 of the actual value of their primary residence.
*   **Important:** Veterans whose 100% disability rating is based *solely* on an Individual Unemployability (TDIU) determination do not qualify for this specific state exemption.

### Active Duty Military Pay Tax Exemption
Colorado residents on active duty stationed outside the U.S. can exempt their military pay from state income tax, provided they spend at least 305 days outside the U.S. during the tax year.

### Military Retirement Pay Tax Exemption
Military retirees can exclude a portion of their retired military pay from state taxable income, based on age:
*   **Under age 55:** Up to $7,500
*   **Ages 55-64:** Up to $20,000
*   **Age 65 and over:** Up to $24,000

## Education & Training

### State Tuition Assistance for National Guard
Members of the Colorado National Guard are eligible for state-funded tuition assistance, covering up to 100% of tuition at state-funded schools (contingent on funding). A service commitment of two years is required for each year of assistance received.

### In-State Tuition
Veterans and their dependents who establish residency in Colorado are eligible for in-state tuition rates without the standard 12-month waiting period. This significantly increases the value of federal GI Bill benefits.

## Employment Services

Beyond the hiring preference, Colorado offers several employment support programs:

*   **Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E):** A federal program run through the Denver VA Regional Benefit Office to help veterans with service-connected disabilities find and maintain employment through job training, coaching, and resume development.
*   **State Workforce Centers:** These centers have dedicated veterans' representatives who provide specialized career assistance, job search support, and skills translation.

## Healthcare & Wellness

### Federal VA Healthcare
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides comprehensive healthcare services. The Denver VA Regional Benefit Office can assist with understanding eligibility and applying for benefits.

### State Veterans' Community Living Centers (Nursing Homes)
Colorado operates five state veterans' nursing homes that provide long-term skilled nursing care, rehabilitation, and domiciliary (assisted living) care. These centers are located in:
*   Aurora
*   Florence
*   Homelake (Monte Vista)
*   Rifle
*   Walsenburg

Eligibility is open to honorably discharged veterans, their spouses, and Gold-Star parents who meet medical admission criteria. The VA subsidizes the cost, often making it more affordable than private facilities.

### Mental Health & Crisis Support
For immediate mental health support, the **Veterans Crisis Line** is available 24/7.
*   **Call:** `988` and then press `1`
*   **Text:** `838255`
*   **TTY:** Use your preferred relay service to call `711` then `988`

## Housing Assistance

### VA Home Loan Guaranties
This significant federal benefit helps eligible veterans and service members purchase a home with favorable terms, often requiring no down payment or private mortgage insurance.

### Grants for Home Modifications
Disabled veterans may qualify for federal VA grants (e.g., SAH or SHA grants) to build, buy, or modify a home to accommodate their disabilities.

## Burial & Memorial Benefits

Colorado honors its veterans with both state and federal burial options.

*   **Veterans Memorial Cemetery of Western Colorado:** A state-operated cemetery managed by the DMVA.
*   **Fort Logan National Cemetery:** A federal cemetery located in Denver.
*   **Pre-Need Burial Planning:** The Denver VA Regional Benefit Office can help veterans determine their eligibility for burial benefits in advance to ease the burden on their families.

## Recreational Licenses & Park Access

*   **Free Disabled Veteran License Plates:** Veterans with a VA disability rating of 50% or greater are eligible for one free set of DV license plates for life.
*   **Free State Parks Access:** Veterans with the Colorado Disabled Veterans license plate receive free admission to all Colorado state parks. All veterans and active-duty military receive free admission during the month of August and on Veterans Day.
*   **Lifetime Hunting & Fishing License:** A free lifetime combination small-game hunting and fishing license is available to resident veterans with a permanent service-connected disability of 60% or more.
*   **Resident-Rate Licenses for Active Duty:** Active-duty personnel stationed in Colorado can purchase hunting and fishing licenses at resident rates.
