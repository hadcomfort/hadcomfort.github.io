# Washington Veterans' Preference

In recognition of their service, Washington state law provides a preference to eligible veterans in appointments to state jobs, political subdivisions, and municipal corporations. The preference is generally applied by adding points to passing examination scores.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Washington state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

An eligible individual includes:
*   A veteran who received an honorable discharge and has served in any branch of the armed forces, including the National Guard and reserves.
*   The surviving spouse or registered domestic partner of an eligible veteran.
*   **Note:** The preference does not apply to veterans who voluntarily retired with 20 or more years of active service and receive military retirement pay over $500 per month.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** Points are added to passing scores on competitive examinations for initial employment.
    *   **10%** is added for a veteran who served during a period of war or in an armed conflict and is not receiving military retirement.
    *   **5%** is added for a veteran who did not serve during a period of war or in an armed conflict, or who is receiving military retirement.
*   **Promotional Preference:** A 5% preference is added to the first promotional examination score for a veteran who was called to active duty while already employed by the state.
*   **Layoff Preference:** An eligible veteran's seniority is increased by their total active military service (up to five years) for layoff purposes.

## How to Apply

Applicants must request veterans' preference at the time they submit their application for a state position. If an employment offer is made, you will be required to provide documentation of a qualifying discharge, such as a DD Form 214 or NGB Form 22.
