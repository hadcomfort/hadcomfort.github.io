# Vermont Veterans' Preference

Vermont offers a veterans' preference for state employment opportunities by adding points to examination scores for eligible individuals. Those eligible for preference may also apply for jobs that are typically only available to current state promotional candidates.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Vermont state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

The following individuals are eligible for preference:
*   Veterans who served on active duty for at least 90 days and received an honorable discharge.
*   Veterans with a service-connected disability.
*   Spouses of veterans who have a total service-connected disability.
*   Unremarried surviving spouses of eligible veterans.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** Points are added to the passing scores of applicants on competitive examinations.
*   **Expanded Eligibility:** Eligible veterans and spouses may apply and compete for vacant positions that are posted as "State Promotional Only."

## How to Apply

Applicants should claim their veteran status during the application process for a state position. You will likely be required to provide proof of service and eligibility, such as a DD Form 214 and, if applicable, a VA disability letter.
