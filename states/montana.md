# Montana Veterans' Preference

The Montana Veterans' Public Employment Preference Act provides a hiring preference to veterans, disabled veterans, and eligible relatives when applying for public employment. [3]

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Montana state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To claim Veterans' Employment Preference, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen and meet one of the following criteria: [3]
*   A veteran who was separated under honorable conditions and served more than 180 consecutive days of active duty.
*   A member of the reserves who served on federal military duty during a period of war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge is authorized.
*   A member of the Montana Army or Air National Guard who has satisfactorily completed a minimum of 6 years of service.

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** When a scored procedure is used, 5 percentage points are added to a veteran's score, and 10 percentage points are added to the score of a disabled veteran or eligible relative. [4]
*   **Categorical Preference:** When a selection procedure other than a scored procedure is used, the public employer must give preference to a disabled veteran, a veteran, and then an eligible relative over any non-preferred applicant with substantially equal qualifications. [4]
*   **Guaranteed Interview:** A public employer may provide for a guaranteed job interview for a veteran who meets the required qualifications for the position and has requested a preference. [4]

## How to Apply

To claim Veterans' Employment Preference, applicants must complete the Employee Preference portion of the online job application and provide appropriate documentation, such as a DD-214. [2, 3]
