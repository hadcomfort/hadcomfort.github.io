# Alabama Veterans' Preference and Benefits

Alabama offers a range of benefits to its veterans, from hiring preferences in state employment to tax exemptions and educational assistance. This page provides a summary of some of the key benefits available to eligible veterans, their spouses, and their families.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary of benefits. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Alabama state government resources and enabling legislation.

## State Employment Hiring Preference

Alabama provides a veterans' preference in the form of points added to passing examination scores for state employment. This preference is available to eligible veterans, their spouses, and surviving spouses.

### Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for the hiring preference, an individual must have been honorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces. The preference also extends to:

*   Spouses of disabled veterans who are unable to work due to their service-connected disability.
*   The unremarried surviving spouse of a service member killed in the line of duty.

### Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based:** Eligible applicants receive points added to their passing examination scores for state employment applications.
    *   **Standard Veterans:** Receive 5 preference points.
    *   **Disabled Veterans:** Veterans receiving disability compensation from the VA receive 10 preference points.
    *   **Eligible Spouses/Surviving Spouses:** Receive 10 preference points.
*   **Reduction in Force:** In the event of a workforce reduction, employees eligible for veterans' preference who have a good record and an efficiency rating equal to or greater than other employees in competition must be the last to be discharged, dropped, or reduced in rank or salary.

### How to Apply

Applicants should indicate their veteran status on their state employment application. You will be required to provide proof of service and eligibility, such as a DD Form 214 and, if applicable, a VA disability rating letter. For more information, you can contact the Alabama State Personnel Department.
