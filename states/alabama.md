# Alabama Veterans' Preference and Benefits

Alabama offers a comprehensive range of benefits to its veterans, from hiring preferences in state employment and robust educational scholarships to tax exemptions and long-term care in state-run homes. This page provides a summary of the key benefits available to eligible veterans, their spouses, and their families, expanded with detailed information to help you access your earned entitlements.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary of benefits. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Alabama state government resources and enabling legislation.

## Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs (ADVA)

The Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs (ADVA) is the primary state agency dedicated to serving Alabama's veterans and their families. Its core mission is to provide advocacy and education to ensure access to state and federal benefits, high-quality long-term nursing care, and dignified burial honors.

A cornerstone of ADVA's support is its network of **62 Veterans Service Offices (VSOs)**, typically located in or near county courthouses. These offices provide free assistance with benefits questions and applications. You can find your nearest VSO using the [locator page on the ADVA website](https://va.alabama.gov/service-officers/).

**Key ADVA Contact Information:**
*   **Physical Address:** 100 North Union Street, Suite 850, Montgomery, Alabama 36104
*   **Telephone:** 334-242-5077

## State Employment Hiring Preference

Alabama provides a veterans' preference in the form of points added to passing examination scores for state employment. This preference is available to eligible veterans, their spouses, and surviving spouses.

### Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for the hiring preference, an individual must have been honorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces. The preference also extends to:
*   Spouses of disabled veterans who are unable to work due to their service-connected disability.
*   The unremarried surviving spouse of a service member killed in the line of duty.

### Type of Preference
*   **Points-Based:** Eligible applicants receive points added to their passing examination scores for state employment applications.
    *   **Standard Veterans:** Receive 5 preference points.
    *   **Disabled Veterans:** Veterans receiving disability compensation from the VA receive 10 preference points.
    *   **Eligible Spouses/Surviving Spouses:** Receive 10 preference points.

*   **Reduction in Force:** In the event of a workforce reduction, employees eligible for veterans' preference who have a good record and an efficiency rating equal to or greater than other employees in competition must be the last to be discharged, dropped, or reduced in rank or salary.

*   **Criminal Conviction Disclosure:** While criminal convictions must be disclosed on an application, they do not serve as an automatic disqualification for employment. This balanced approach prioritizes honesty and individual assessment over automatic exclusion. However, failure to disclose any conviction can be grounds for disqualification.

### How to Apply

Applicants should indicate their veteran status on their state employment application. You will be required to provide proof of service and eligibility, such as a DD Form 214 and, if applicable, a VA disability rating letter. For more information, contact the Alabama State Personnel Department.
