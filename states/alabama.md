# Arkansas Veterans' Preference

Arkansas provides a veterans' preference for qualified veterans, their spouses, and surviving spouses in hiring, promotion, and retention for state employment. The preference is applied when developing the list of candidates to be interviewed and again when making the final selection.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Arkansas state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible, an applicant must be a citizen and resident of Arkansas and have qualifications substantially equal to other applicants. An applicant entitled to preference cannot be disqualified due to age or physical disability, provided it does not hinder their ability to perform the job duties. The preference applies to:

*   **Veterans:** A person honorably discharged from a tour of active duty, which cannot be for training purposes only.
*   **National Guard/Reserves:** Any person who has served honorably for at least six years in the National Guard or reserve forces.
*   **Disabled Veterans:** A veteran with a service-connected disability established by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. This includes veterans over age 55 who are entitled to a pension or compensation.
*   **Spouses of Disabled Veterans:** The spouse of a disabled veteran whose disability disqualifies them from being selected for the position.
*   **Unmarried Surviving Spouses:** The surviving spouse of a deceased qualified veteran, provided they are unmarried at the time of application and hiring.

## Type of Preference

Preference is applied differently depending on whether a numerical scoring system is used for hiring.

*   **When a Numerical Score is Used:** If an examination or other scored evaluation is used to create a list of qualified candidates, points are added to the final passing score of an eligible applicant.
    *   **5 points** are added for eligible veterans, members of the National Guard/Reserves, and their unmarried surviving spouses.
    *   **10 points** are added for disabled veterans or the spouse of a disabled veteran who is disqualified from the position due to their disability.

*   **When a Numerical Score is Not Used:** The hiring authority must be able to demonstrate how veteran's preference was applied in developing the list of candidates to be interviewed and in selecting the final candidate.

*   **Promotion and Retention:** A qualified veteran's status must be considered in decisions regarding promotions. In a reduction-in-force scenario, a veteran's status is counted as part of the employee's seniority.

## How to Apply and Applicant Rights

An applicant must voluntarily submit official proof of their status, such as a DD-214 or a letter from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, to the hiring authority to receive preference.

If an applicant eligible for veteran's preference is not hired, they may request that the hiring authority provide the reason in writing.
*   If scoring was used, the applicant can request their base score, their adjusted score, and the successful candidate's score.
*   If no scoring was used, the applicant can request all documentation demonstrating how preference was applied to develop the interview list and select the successful candidate.
