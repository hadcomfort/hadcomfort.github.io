# Texas Veterans' Preference

Texas law provides a preference in employment to veterans, surviving spouses of veterans, and orphans of veterans for positions in state agencies or offices. The preference applies to both hiring and retention in the case of a workforce reduction.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Texas state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

An individual must meet the following criteria to qualify:
*   **Veterans:** A person who served in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, or Marine Corps of the United States, or the Texas military forces, and was honorably discharged.
*   **Surviving Spouses:** The surviving spouse of a veteran who was killed on active duty and who has not remarried.
*   **Orphans:** The orphan of a veteran who was killed while on active duty.

## Type of Preference

*   **Interview Preference:** An individual entitled to a veteran's preference is guaranteed an interview for a position if they meet the minimum qualifications. If six or fewer applicants are chosen for an interview, at least one must be a qualified veteran. If more than six are interviewed, at least 20% must be qualified veterans.
*   **Hiring Preference:** If two applicants are finalists for a position and are determined to have equal qualifications, the veteran must be offered the job. Preference is prioritized as follows: 1) a veteran with a disability, 2) a veteran, 3) a surviving spouse, and 4) an orphan.
*   **Retention Preference:** The preference also applies during a reduction in force, giving the veteran preference in retaining their position.

## How to Apply

Applicants should indicate their veteran status when applying for a state position. You will be required to provide a copy of your DD Form 214 or a similar document at the time of hiring to verify eligibility.
