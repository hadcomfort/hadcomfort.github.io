# Virginia Veterans' Preference

In accordance with the Code of Virginia, the Commonwealth provides a hiring preference to eligible veterans, their surviving spouses, and children for state employment positions. Virginia also allows private employers to voluntarily offer a hiring preference to veterans.

**Disclaimer:** This is a summary. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the official Virginia state government resources linked at the bottom of this page.

## Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for preference, an applicant must be:
*   **A Veteran:** A person who received an honorable discharge and has either served more than 180 consecutive days of active duty or has a service-connected disability.
*   **A Surviving Spouse or Child:** The surviving spouse or child of a veteran who was killed in the line of duty.
*   **A Member of the Virginia National Guard.**

## Type of Preference

*   **Points-Based (for exams):** For positions requiring a written examination, the grade of an eligible applicant is increased by 5%. This increase applies only to passing scores.
*   **Interview Preference:** For positions that do not use an examination, eligible applicants who meet the knowledge, skill, and ability requirements must be given preference during the selection process.
*   **Tie-Breaker:** When an eligible applicant's qualifications are "substantially equal" to the best-qualified applicant not eligible for preference, the veteran must be offered the job. [2]
*   **Special Consideration:** Additional consideration is given to veterans with a service-connected disability.

## How to Apply

On the state job application, you must indicate that you are a veteran, surviving spouse, or child to be considered for the preference. Documentation of military service is not required during the application process but may be requested upon hiring.
