# Case Study: Maria's Story - Using 10-Point Preference

**Veteran:** Maria, 42 years old.
**Service:** 6 years active duty, Marine Corps.
**Disability/Medals:** Received a Purple Heart. Also has a 20% service-connected disability rating from the VA.
**Goal:** Apply for a competitive Program Analyst (GS-12) position.

### The Challenge
The Program Analyst position was highly competitive. Maria knew her experience was strong, but she wanted to ensure she received all the advantages she had earned through her service.

### The Solution: 10-Point Preference (XP and CP)
Maria is eligible for 10-point preference under two different categories:
1.  **XP Preference:** For receipt of a Purple Heart.
2.  **CP Preference:** For a compensable disability rating between 10-29%.

She only needs to qualify for one to get 10 points.

**The Process:**
1.  Maria applied for the GS-12 position through the competitive process on USAJOBS.
2.  In her application, she claimed 10-point preference.
3.  She completed the **SF-15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference**.
4.  She submitted her application package including her resume, her DD Form 214 (which listed the Purple Heart), her VA disability rating letter, and the completed SF-15.
5.  The agency's HR specialists reviewed her application and determined she met the qualifications for the job, rating her with a score of 92.
6.  Because she was a 10-point preference eligible, 10 points were added to her score, for a final rating of **102**.

### The Outcome
With her augmented score of 102, Maria's name was placed very high on the certificate of eligibles referred to the hiring manager. The hiring manager was impressed with her qualifications and her high ranking. After a successful interview, she was offered the position. Her 10-point preference gave her a significant advantage in the competitive ranking process.
