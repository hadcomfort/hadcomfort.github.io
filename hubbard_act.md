# The Hubbard Act (Sole Survivor Preference)

The Hubbard Act provides a specific type of 0-point preference, often called 'sole survivorship preference,' for individuals released or discharged from active duty military service under certain circumstances involving the death or permanent disability of family members who also served in the armed forces. On August 29, 2008, the Hubbard Act was enacted as Public Law 110-317. This Act amended the eligibility categories for veterans’ preference by adding this new category for veterans released or discharged from active duty after August 29, 2008, due to a “sole survivorship discharge.” This is also known as 0-point Preference (SSP).

## Definition of Sole Survivorship Preference

The Hubbard Act established a new veterans’ preference eligibility category specifically for veterans who received a sole survivorship discharge.

## Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for Sole Survivor Preference, a veteran must meet the following conditions:

*   Be the **only surviving child** in a family where the father, mother, or one or more siblings:
    *   Served in the armed forces, **AND**
    *   Met one of the following conditions:
        *   Was killed.
        *   Died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease.
        *   Is in a captured or missing in action status.
        *   Is permanently 100 percent disabled or hospitalized on a continuing basis (and is not employed gainfully because of the disability or hospitalization).
    *   The death, status, or disability **did not result from intentional misconduct or willful neglect** of the parent or sibling and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.
*   The veteran must have been released or discharged from a period of active duty from the armed forces **after August 29, 2008**, by reason of a “sole survivorship discharge.”

## How Preference is Applied

Under the sole survivorship preference:

*   The individual **does not receive veterans’ preference points** (like 5 or 10 points) that are typically added to passing scores when the “rule of 3” is applied.
*   However, the individual **is entitled to be listed ahead of non-preference eligibles** who have the same score on an examination.
*   If an agency is using category rating, the individual is listed ahead of non-preference eligibles in the same quality category.

## Entitlements

Individuals qualifying for Sole Survivor Preference are entitled to:

*   Receive the **same pass over rights** as other preference eligibles. This means an agency cannot simply pass over them to select a non-preference eligible with the same or lower ranking without valid reasons.
*   **Credit experience in the armed forces** to meet the qualification requirements for Federal jobs.

This preference is distinct from other types (like 5-point or 10-point preference) and applies in very specific family tragedy situations related to military service. As a 0-point preference, it grants eligibility to be treated as a preference eligible for application and tie-breaking purposes but does not add numerical points to a competitive examination score.
