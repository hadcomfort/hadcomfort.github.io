# Special Appointing Authorities for Veterans

Several special appointing authorities are available to assist eligible veterans in obtaining federal employment. These authorities recognize the sacrifices of veterans and aim to facilitate their entry or return to the civil service.

## Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) Authority

The VRA authority allows agencies to appoint eligible veterans to positions up to GS-11 or equivalent without competition. These are excepted appointments to positions that would otherwise be in the competitive service.

**Eligibility Criteria:**
An individual must be separated under honorable conditions (honorable or general discharge) AND meet one of the following:
*   Be a disabled veteran; OR
*   Served on active duty in the Armed Forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; OR
*   Participated in a U.S. military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded while serving on active duty; OR
*   Be a "recently separated veteran."
*Note: Veterans claiming eligibility based on a campaign or expedition medal must be in receipt of that medal. Not all 5-point preference eligibles are VRA eligible.*

**Making Appointments:**
*   Agencies can appoint any VRA eligible who meets the basic qualifications for the position without announcing the job or rating/ranking applicants.
*   However, if an agency has two or more VRA candidates and one or more is preference eligible, Veterans' preference procedures (5 CFR Part 302) must be applied.
*   Agencies must consider all qualified VRA candidates on file.

**Terms and Conditions of Employment:**
*   VRA appointees can be promoted, demoted, reassigned, or transferred similarly to career employees. Time-in-grade requirements apply for promotions.
*   A new VRA appointment to a higher grade (up to GS-11) can be made at agency discretion if the employee is qualified, without regard to time-in-grade.
*   Agencies must establish a training/education program for VRA appointees with less than 15 years of education.
*   **Conversion:** After two years of satisfactory service, the agency must convert the VRA appointee to a career or career-conditional appointment.

**Appeal Rights:**
*   During the first year, VRA appointees have limited appeal rights like competitive service probationers.
*   Otherwise, they have appeal rights of excepted service employees. Preference eligible VRAs gain adverse action protections after one year. Non-preference eligible VRAs gain these protections after two years of current continuous employment in the same or similar position.

**Nonpermanent Appointment Based on VRA Eligibility:**
Agencies can make noncompetitive temporary or term appointments based on VRA eligibility at authorized grade levels. These are not VRA appointments and do not lead to conversion.

**Citations:**
*   38 U.S.C. 4214
*   Pub. L. 107-288
*   5 CFR Part 307
*   5 CFR 752.401(c)(3)

## 30 Percent or More Disabled Veterans

This authority allows agencies to give a noncompetitive temporary appointment (more than 60 days) or a term appointment to certain disabled veterans.

**Eligibility Criteria:**
The veteran must be:
*   Retired from active military service with a disability rating of 30 percent or more; OR
*   Rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (since 1991 or later, including determinations from a branch of the Armed Forces at any time) as having a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more.

**Terms and Conditions:**
*   There is no grade level limitation for this authority.
*   The appointee must meet all qualification requirements, including any written test.
*   **Conversion:** The agency may convert the employee to a career or career-conditional appointment at any time during the temporary or term appointment, without a break in service.

**Citations:**
*   5 U.S.C. 3112
*   5 CFR 316.302, 316.402
*   5 CFR 315.707

## Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program

Disabled veterans eligible for training under the VA vocational rehabilitation program can gain work experience or training at a federal agency.

**How it Works:**
*   Veterans enroll for training/work experience under an agreement between the agency and VA.
*   During the program, the veteran is a VA beneficiary, not a federal employee for most purposes.
*   Training is tailored to individual needs and goals; no set length.
*   If training is for eventual appointment, the agency must ensure it enables the veteran to meet qualification requirements.

**Certificate of Training and Appointment:**
*   Upon successful completion, the agency and VA issue a Certificate of Training detailing the occupational series and grade level.
*   This certificate allows any agency to appoint the veteran noncompetitively via a status quo appointment.
*   **Conversion:** This appointment may be converted to career or career-conditional at any time.

**Citations:**
*   38 U.S.C. chapter 31
*   5 CFR 3.1
*   5 CFR 315.604

## Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA)

The VEOA allows preference eligibles or eligible veterans to apply for positions announced under merit promotion procedures when an agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce.

**Eligibility Requirements:**
An applicant must be:
*   A preference eligible; OR
*   A veteran separated from the armed forces after 3 or more years of continuous active service performed under honorable conditions (veterans released shortly before completing a 3-year tour are considered eligible).
    *   "Active service" includes active duty in uniformed services, full-time training duty, annual training duty, full-time National Guard duty, and attendance at a designated service school while in active service.

**How it Works:**
*   VEOA provides access to compete for merit promotion vacancies open to candidates outside the agency's workforce.
*   It is not an entitlement to the position or a guarantee of selection.
*   Veterans' preference is *not* a factor in VEOA appointments as these are merit promotion actions.
*   VEOA eligibles are rated and ranked with other merit promotion candidates. If selected from among the best qualified, they receive a career or career-conditional appointment.

**Terms and Conditions of Employment:**
*   Veterans appointed under VEOA (after amendments by Pub. L. 106-117) receive career or career-conditional appointments.
*   Those appointed under earlier Schedule B authority who competed under merit promotion procedures were to be converted retroactively. Those appointed noncompetitively under Schedule B remain so until they compete.
*   All employees appointed under VEOA are subject to a probationary period and agency merit promotion plan requirements.
*   Legal authority for new VEOA appointments: ZBA-Pub. L. 106-117, Sec 511.

**Appeal Rights:**
*   Employees appointed to the competitive service have competitive service appeal rights.
*   Those under Schedule B (appointed prior to amendments or noncompetitively) have excepted service appeal rights.

**Citations:**
*   5 U.S.C. 3304, 3330
*   5 CFR 213.3202(n) (refers to the older Schedule B authority)
*   5 CFR 335.106
*   Pub. L. 106-117, Section 511 (for new VEOA appointments)
