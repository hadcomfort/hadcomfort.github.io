# Welcome to the Veterans Information Resource

This site is dedicated to providing helpful tools for U.S. veterans and their families. Featured here is the **Veteran's Preference Advisor**, an interactive guide designed to simplify the complexities of veteran's preference and help you understand your potential eligibility for federal employment.

This Advisor is an **unofficial resource**. It has been developed by carefully structuring information from official U.S. government guidelines into an easy-to-follow, step-by-step format. Our aim is to make this complex topic more accessible.

## What is Veteran's Preference?

Veteran's preference, in its present form, originates from the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944. It is a recognition of the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform and aims to restore veterans to a favorable competitive position for Government employment. Since the Civil War, the United States has acknowledged the sacrifices of its service members by enacting laws to prevent veterans seeking Federal employment from being penalized for their time in military service. This preference also acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans.

Essentially, veteran's preference gives eligible veterans an advantage in hiring for most federal jobs. It doesn't guarantee a job, but it does provide advantages such as adding points to passing examination scores or giving preference in selection from competitive lists of eligibles or during reductions in force. Understanding your specific preference category (e.g., 0-point, 5-point, 10-point based on factors like service period, disability, etc.) is key to leveraging this benefit.

## What You'll Gain by Using This Tool

Navigating veteran's preference can be challenging. This tool is designed to help you:

* **Clarify your eligibility:** Determine if your service qualifies you for preference, and understand the specific type of preference you might be eligible for (e.g., 5-point, 10-point, derived preference for spouses/mothers, or 0-point sole survivorship preference).
* **Simplify complex rules:** Easily navigate confusing regulations, definitions (like what constitutes "active duty" for preference), and understand how different service periods or campaign involvements impact eligibility—a common challenge this tool is built to address.
* **Increase your preparedness:** Confidently identify relevant job postings and understand your application advantages when applying for federal positions.
* **Equip yourself with knowledge:** Be better prepared for discussions with Veteran Service Officers (VSO) or HR personnel regarding your status and the documentation needed (like the SF-15 for 10-point preference).
* **Learn where preference applies:** Understand the types of Federal jobs where preference is applied (e.g., competitive and excepted services in the executive branch) and where it generally does not (e.g., Senior Executive Service, legislative/judicial branches unless specified).

## How the Veteran's Preference Advisor Works

You (or the veteran you are assisting) will be guided through a series of questions. Each step is a separate page within the `/advisor/` section of this site:

1.  Read the question or information carefully on each page.
2.  Select the option that best applies to the veteran's situation.
3.  This will take you to the next relevant step in the decision tree.

*Example: The advisor might ask, "Did you serve on active duty in the Armed Forces during specific wartime periods or in a military campaign for which a campaign medal was authorized?" Based on your 'yes' or 'no' answer, and potentially follow-up questions about dates or medals, it will guide you to the next relevant question to narrow down your eligibility.*

Continue through the pages until you reach a determination of the potential veteran's preference category.

## Before You Begin

To make the process smoother, you may find it helpful to have the following information or documents available:

* The veteran's discharge papers (e.g., DD Form 214)
* Information on any service-connected disability ratings from the VA
* Other relevant service records
