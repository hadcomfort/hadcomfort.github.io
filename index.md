# Welcome to the Veterans Information Resource

This site is dedicated to providing helpful tools for U.S. veterans and their families. Featured here is the **Veteran's Preference Advisor**, an interactive guide designed to simplify the complexities of veteran's preference and help you understand your potential eligibility for federal employment.

This Advisor is an **unofficial resource**. It has been developed by carefully structuring information from official U.S. government guidelines into an easy-to-follow, step-by-step format. Our aim is to make this complex topic more accessible.

## What is Veteran's Preference?

Veteran's preference gives eligible veterans an advantage in hiring for most federal jobs. It doesn't guarantee a job, but it does add points to passing scores or gives preference in selection for certain positions. Understanding your specific preference category is key.

## What You'll Gain by Using This Tool

Navigating veteran's preference can be challenging. This tool is designed to help you:

* **Clarify your eligibility:** Get a clear understanding of your potential standing for veteran's preference.
* **Simplify complex rules:** Easily navigate confusing regulations and understand how different service periods impact eligibility—a common challenge this tool is built to address.
* **Increase your preparedness:** Confidently identify relevant job postings and understand your application advantages.
* **Equip yourself with knowledge:** Be better prepared for discussions with Veteran Service Officers (VSO) or HR personnel regarding your status.

## How the Veteran's Preference Advisor Works

You (or the veteran you are assisting) will be guided through a series of questions. Each step is a separate page within the `/advisor/` section of this site:

1.  Read the question or information carefully on each page.
2.  Select the option that best applies to the veteran's situation.
3.  This will take you to the next relevant step in the decision tree.

Continue through the pages until you reach a determination of the potential veteran's preference category.

## Before You Begin

To make the process smoother, you may find it helpful to have the following information or documents available:

* The veteran's discharge papers (e.g., DD Form 214)
* Information on any service-connected disability ratings from the VA
* Other relevant service records
