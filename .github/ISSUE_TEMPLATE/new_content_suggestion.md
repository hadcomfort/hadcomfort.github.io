*Example: "A detailed page explaining the difference between Title 5 and Title 38 definitions of 'war' for preference purposes."*

### Why would this new content be valuable?
Please explain why this information is important and how it would help users of the Veteran's Preference Advisor.
*Example: "This is a common point of confusion for veterans who receive VA benefits but may not qualify for preference under Title 5 rules. A dedicated page would clarify this."*
