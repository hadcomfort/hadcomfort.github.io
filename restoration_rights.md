# Restoration Rights After Uniformed Service (USERRA)

Federal employees who perform duty in a uniformed service are entitled to certain restoration rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). These rights ensure that employees can return to their civilian jobs after completing their military service.

## Basic Entitlement

Any Federal employee (permanent or temporary) in an executive agency (including the U.S. Postal Service, Postal Rate Commission, and nonappropriated fund activities, but excluding intelligence agencies) who performs duty with a uniformed service is entitled to be restored to the position they would have attained had they not entered the uniformed service. This applies whether the service was voluntary or involuntary.

"Uniformed service" includes:
*   The Armed Forces.
*   The Army and Air National Guard when engaged in active duty for training, inactive duty training, or full-time National Guard duty.
*   The commissioned corps of the Public Health Service.
*   Any other category of persons designated by the President in time of war or emergency.

Employees in intelligence agencies have similar rights but are covered under their respective agency regulations and have different appeal rights. While on duty, the agency carries the employee on leave without pay unless separation is requested (which does not affect restoration rights).

## Conditions for Restoration

To be eligible for restoration rights, the employee must meet the following conditions:

1.  **Advance Notice:** The employee must have given advance notice of their departure to the agency, unless prevented by military circumstances.
2.  **Honorable Release:** The employee must have been released from uniformed service under honorable conditions.
3.  **Service Duration:** The cumulative total of service must not exceed 5 years. Exceptions exist for training, involuntary active duty extensions, and to complete an initial service obligation of more than 5 years.
4.  **Timely Application:** The employee must apply for restoration within the appropriate time limits.

## Time Limits for Reporting or Applying

The time limits for an employee to report back to work or apply for reemployment depend on the duration of their uniformed service:

*   **Less than 31 days (or for a fitness exam):** Must report back to work at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled workday following completion of service and the expiration of 8 hours after safe transportation back to their residence.
*   **More than 30 but less than 181 days:** Must apply for reemployment no later than 14 days after completion of service.
*   **More than 180 days:** Have 90 days after completion of service to apply for restoration.

Failure to meet these time limits can subject the employee to disciplinary action. Agencies must reemploy individuals as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days after receiving the application. Agencies can request documentation to verify the length and character of service and the timeliness of the application.

## Positions to Which Employees Are Restored

The position to which an employee is restored depends on the length of their service:

*   **Service less than 91 days:** Must be placed in the position they would have attained had their employment not been interrupted. If not qualified for that position after reasonable agency efforts to qualify them, they are entitled to the position they left.
*   **Service more than 90 days:** Similar rights, but the agency has the option to place the employee in a position for which they are qualified that is of like seniority, status, and pay.
*   **Employees with service-connected disabilities:** If not qualified for the above positions, they must be reemployed in a position that most closely approximates the position they would have been entitled to, consistent with their circumstances.
*   **Time-limited appointments:** Employees under such appointments will complete the unexpired portion upon their return.

## Service Credit

Upon restoration, employees are generally treated as though they had never left military service. Time spent in uniformed service counts for:

*   Seniority
*   Within-grade increases
*   Completion of probation
*   Career tenure
*   Retirement (a deposit to the retirement fund is usually required; specific rules apply for CSRS and FERS, and for service interrupting civilian duty)
*   Leave rate accrual (though sick or annual leave is not earned while off the rolls or in nonpay status)

Special rules apply for crediting National Guard service, particularly for full-time service after August 1, 1990, that interrupted federal civilian employment.

## Employee Protections

USERRA provides significant protections for employees:

*   **Protection from Reduction in Force (RIF):** Employees are not subject to RIF while serving in the uniformed services.
    *   If service was for more than 180 days, they may not be separated by RIF (except for cause) for 1 year after their return.
    *   If service was for more than 30 but less than 181 days, they may not be separated by RIF (except for cause) for 6 months after their return. (A RIF is not considered "for cause").
*   **Non-discrimination and No Reprisal:** The law expressly prohibits discrimination or acts of reprisal against an applicant or employee due to their application, membership, or service in the uniformed services.
