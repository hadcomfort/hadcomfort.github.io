# Case Study: David's Story - Qualifying with 5-Point Preference

**Veteran:** David, 30 years old.
**Service:** 5 years active duty, Air Force. Separated with an Honorable discharge.
**Medals:** Received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (AFEM) for service in a qualifying operation. No service-connected disability.
**Goal:** Apply for a competitive Logistics Management Specialist (GS-9) position.

### The Challenge
David has excellent logistics experience from his time in the Air Force, but the GS-9 position he wants is popular and attracts many qualified applicants. He wants to ensure he gets credit for his military service.

### The Solution: 5-Point Preference (TP)
David is eligible for 5-point preference (TP) because he received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, which is a qualifying campaign medal.

**The Process:**
1.  David applied for the GS-9 position on USAJOBS.
2.  In his application, he claimed 5-point veteran's preference. He did not need to fill out the SF-15 form, as that is for 10-point preference.
3.  He submitted his application package, including his resume and his DD Form 214, which clearly lists the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal in Box 18.
4.  The agency's HR specialists reviewed his application and determined he met the qualifications for the job. They gave him an initial rating of 88 based on his experience.
5.  Because he was a 5-point preference eligible, 5 points were added to his score, for a final rating of **93**.

### The Outcome
With his final score of 93, David was placed high on the list of eligible candidates referred to the hiring manager. This improved his chances of being selected for an interview. The hiring manager was impressed with his military experience, and his preference-augmented score helped him stand out. After a strong interview, David was offered the job.
